Or maybe he did. Maybe that was the point all along. After all, Albarn is a melancholy — and adaptable — pop-music wizard who works best in bleak times. That he would stretch out the next Gorillaz album across several months as a singles series called Song Machine, in which every song pairs Albarn with what feels like a speed dial of his very famous friends — (Peter Hook dusting off his New Order bass on “Aries”; Skepta and Tony Allen, who sadly passed away this past April, dueling on “How Far?”; Elton John toning down the glitter on “The Pink Phantom” with 6LACK) — is a testament to his ability to read the room and reflect pop’s mood, even if it’s not what we want to hear. Albarn, who understands <a href=#>how numbing and bland history can feel</a>, is most proud of this foresight. “I’m a kind of pop Nostradamus,” he laughs. The title is an honor.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgh7ue2m000d3g6ahlyqesnj@published data-word-count=99>Like most Gorillaz albums, Song Machine is interesting as a whole yet more enjoyable as a collection of moments; Blur remains Albarn’s go-to vehicle for making more straightforward albums. The best Song Machine “episode” so far remains “<a href=#>Désolé</a>,” with the excellent singer-actress Fatoumata Diawara leading a minor-key burn that, like Albarn’s best songs, has a calculated off-ness that hits in waves. The remote connection of the Gorillaz feels especially appropriate now. “These episodes will be gripping, no doubt,” he continues. “Gorillaz kind of exist in parallel universes, so we’re able to react in a really fast emotional way now.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgh84apy000h3g6ah6349w65@published data-word-count=123>Albarn compares Song Machine to the freewheelin’ spirit of fan-favorite D-Sides, and it fits nicely alongside the doomsdays of past Gorillaz albums: Y2K (Gorillaz), George Bush (Demon Days), the Great Recession (Plastic Beach), the iPad (The Fall), and Donald Trump (Humanz and The Now Now). As for dealing with the real world, Albarn is just as cryptic as one of Gorillaz co-founder Jamie Hewlett’s cartoons. <strong>“</strong>Life goes on,” he says. “And life will go on. What this has to teach us is to pause. We will get through it, just not everyone will get through it. But that’s the reality on planet Earth any day of the year. We live in an era of hysteria, and this is a manifestation of that hysteria.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckgh85xyw000l3g6agndauoro@published data-word-count=26>As this first series of Song Machine comes to a close this week, Albarn breaks down some of the highs and lows of Gorillaz and beyond.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8swm8c6001p3h673hxvjaqd@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Best Gorillaz Song</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8ualxws00203h67588cr9k5@published data-word-count=109>“Clint Eastwood.” I mean you don’t get more perfect than that, really. It’s just complete hybrid, weird shit. And, you know, it came from switching on the Suzuki Omnichord [a portable electronic instrument] and the first preset was the beat. That can only happen once: [you take an] electronic instrument and the first thing you play you use, and it becomes a massive hit. As a result of that, in the proceeding 20 years I’ve bought a lot of electronic instruments hoping that that eventually would happen again. I mean, maybe we just peaked early, but for me, it wasn’t peaking early because I’d already done 10 years [laughs].</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uansb9002u3h67uppx5jhx@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Best Gorillaz Album</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uaoqvf00343h67scog08n8@published data-word-count=141>They’re all works in progress, really. I suppose in a way the first one [2001’s self-titled] was the most unknown as a journey because I’ve never done anything like that. And then the second one [2005’s Demon Days] was just meeting such a talent in Danger Mouse and collaborating so well together, which was a real revelation. Then the third one [2010’s Plastic Beach] was kind of like the fullest expression of us visually, perhaps. [2017’s] Humanz was a subterranean, weird night. And then [2018’s] The Now Now is kind of, in a way, the same as [2010’s] The Fall; they’re postcards from various places of the world. And this one I don’t know, what will it sound like by the time it’s finished? I have no idea. But it will be interesting. It’s a whole year in our lives really.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uaozgt003a3h6727p7ssa6@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Most Underrated Gorillaz Album</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uapfl0003g3h67faw55wkz@published data-word-count=29>The Fall.

They were just world-class in their delivery. But you’re never going to be able to replace someone like [bassist] Paul Simonon.<strong> </strong>So, it’s different and it’s always different each time. No one can do what [Happy Mondays front man] Shaun Ryder does. When Lou Reed was in the band briefly, it was a totally different experience to when Ike Turner was in the band; and when Dennis Hopper came onstage at the Apollo that was a very different kind of band it turned into. It’s about who is leading the energy in that moment in time.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uavevr004a3h67rnwmwyxn@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Best Jamie Hewlett Moment</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uavv8n004g3h67x7spxu3j@published data-word-count=65>I’m a great fan of the “Tomorrow Comes Today” video.

Just listening at the letterbox. Then they proceeded to tell me that they had written all my songs and it was about time I came clean, and went to the papers and told them they had done it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uaxigq005a3h67yagat7uf@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Best B Side</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uay5yp005m3h674lig6v35@published data-word-count=61>“Hong Kong.” I love that song very dearly. That’s one of my best songs. I feel like it carries a lot of poignancy now. Especially the bit at the end about the DJ being the last one to leave. That’s why writing songs the way I do, there are moments where they have huge clarity, and then they become weird again.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uaxuvk005g3h67lcav15sk@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Most Blur-like Gorillaz Track</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uayqrb005t3h67kyzvzbq1@published data-word-count=112>I don’t feel there’s a huge amount of difference between the two. “Girls and Boys” could have been a great Gorillaz song. “Song 2,” too; Gorillaz has a drum machine. I play all the instruments [laughs], that’s the bloody difference. When you hear Gorillaz, it’s just basically me when it comes to the music. But I mean, rhythmically, it’s different because I work with [producer and Gorillaz dummer] Remi Kabaka. I never worked with Remi when I was in Blur; it’s just different. But my contribution is the same. I don’t suddenly become a different person. In a sense, Gorillaz is what I would have been if I hadn’t been in Blur.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uaz0cz005z3h67g9vho16z@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Most American Thing You’ve Done</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8uaza3l00653h67bluxnsjy@published data-word-count=114>Gorillaz is my most Pan-American band. I include South America in that. Blur was my most British band. And The Good, The Bad & The Queen is my most English band. “Song 2” was an American song. That should have been called “The Wooo-hoo Song.” People are like, “Fucking [Albarn “wooo-hoo’s” loudly] oh hell yeah, I know that one.” The “wooo-hoo’s” they love. The names have always been distracting to what the actual hooks are. Like, “Clint Eastwood” should be “I Ain’t Happy.” That’s probably why “Feel Good Inc.” is my biggest hit ever because it actually has the name in the song. That’s where I’ve been going wrong. I’ve got to amend that.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck8uazqdh006b3h67pwi83oj0@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Best Lyric</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck8ub02ck006h3h67v7dhyqog@published data-word-count=69>I think some of my favorite lyrics are going to be coming down the line, tin about Episode Six or something. But I have to change the title because the person I’ve done it with feels it’s a bit too provocative. That’s deliciously cryptic. I like talking about things that haven’t happened yet. It’s quite a thrill.

I don’t know why I keep doing it to be honest with you. I find it very hard, the whole process. I love writing music. I find it relatively effortless. But the lyrics I find really difficult. I suppose it’s a balance because I find the music so easy, you know, the yin and yang in it. Sometimes I would like to be more like Elton John in the sense that he had Bernie Taupin.
