The couple eventually had two children named Raihan and Miraya. Vadra strongly denied any involvement in legislation and policy making which his wife’s family does. According to him, he is purely a businessman whose attention is entirely focused on his small business Artex, a company that specialises on exporting jewellery.</p><p>In 2008, he partnered with DLF Ltd which enabled him to enter the real estate industry. He then bought lands in Haryana and Rajasthan and acquire shares of stocks in a leading hotel company based in Delhi. Currently, he is the sole owner of Sky Light Hospitality Pvt Ltd, and part owner of Unitech.</p><p>Despite his success, Robert Vadra had to deal with a couple of tragedies in the past regarding his family. His sister Michelle died in 2001, his brother Richard died three years later and in 2009, his father Rajinder hanged himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqfl7KzwIyvmJ2qkah6o7XOoKmaqJiueqetwq1knJmimrKzecCwmKuco2K7psCMsKarrJhiuaqyxGaqraeirnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./qd-vision-color-iq-and-the-philips-276e6-review.html><span>←</span><span>Quantum Dots for Wider Color Gamuts</span></a>
