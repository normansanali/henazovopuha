And long after The Golden Girls ended, yet another generation began to discover this enduring comedic genius and, among other things, share their favorite Betty White quotes online.</p><p>An outspoken advocate for both animal and human rights, <a href=# rel=noopener>Betty White</a> paved the way for women in show business in her youth and remained a staunch activist until her death at 99 years old in 2021.</p><p>Her risqué wit delighted countless talkshow audiences and brought in new legions of fans, making her America's favorite uncensored grandmother. Indeed, White spoke freely about sex, love, and divorce right up until the end.</p><p>Discover the best and bawdiest Betty White quotes in the gallery above.</p><h2>How Betty White Became A Hollywood Legend</h2><p>Betty White was <a href=# rel=noopener>born</a> in Oak Park, Illinois, on Jan. 17, 1922, but moved to Los Angeles with her parents when she was two.</p><p>She began a lifelong fascination with animals, while her love for performing saw her <a href=# rel=noopener>appear</a> on radio programs at the age of eight and in plays as a high school teen.</p><p>A model and stage actress upon graduating, World War II saw her working for the American Women's Voluntary Services and marry an Army Pilot in 1945. She humorously explained, as seen in the gallery of Betty White quotes above, that the marriage only lasted a few months and was entirely spent in bed. Her most major career breaks followed a few years later.</p><p>Cast as co-host of Hollywood on Television in 1949, White went on to found her own production company. Her sit-com Life With Elizabeth yielded her an Emmy nomination, while later romantic interests fell by the wayside. White purposefully prioritized her career, which would include a Grammy and eight Emmy wins.</p><p>Her success allowed her to advocate for animals and <a href=# rel=noopener>become</a> an honorary Forest Ranger. Her continuous appeal, meanwhile, led to an online campaign in 2010 to have her host Saturday Night Live.</p><p>It not only worked, but helped reintroduce White to a whole new era — and cameos in major films and shows soon followed.</p><p>White's most famous shows were certainly The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Golden Girls, but she is also famous for her indecent revelations on aging and sex on Larry King Live and The Late Show with David Letterman. Even Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have claimed to have been star-struck when meeting her.</p><p>But perhaps the most inspiring facet of White's story is her lifelong dedication to animal welfare. The Betty White quotes above reveal how honesty and compassion led her through life — and that a diet of vodka and hot dogs might be the secret to a long one.</p><p>After taking a look at these 27 Betty White quotes, check out these <a href=#>33 inspirational quotes for women</a>.
