Regular user would be banned because of that.</p><p>And I DO know that these are not official names. And I can tell why.</p><p>1. Russian has done anime dub (I used to have Pokemon 2 movie in Russian dub) but it's a dub. So, it was never written. We don't know their written versions. And I doubt that Russian anime has gone SO far. Hebrew dub has gone to Advanced. I don't know if it came further.</p><p>2. Russian and Hebrew versions have only anime. No russian games, no russian manga, no hebrew games, no hebrew manga. So, characters like Hoenn E4 or Wallace CAN'T have their official Hebrew/Russian names.</p><p>3. I'm pretty sure that Hebrew Names are from pokemon.co.il fansite. Not sure about Russian ones. Fansite - that's the keyword. The owner of these fansites apparently mispronounced some names and the transliterations are just INACCURATE.</p><p>There is no OFFICIAL source of Russian/Hebrew names. They are just fantranslated. We can transliterate the English human names to Greek or every other alphabet in this world. But that's not our policy. They won't be official international names.</p><p>Ketsuban, are you holding a grudge against me? You, Americans are way to sulky! I'm sure you will be holding a grudge against me as long as you live.</p><p>And does the fact that I want to delete Hebrew names automatically make me an Antisemite?</p><p>I'm not any racist. I just don't like my country.
