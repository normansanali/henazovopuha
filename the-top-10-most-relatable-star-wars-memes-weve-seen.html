The famous sand monologue from Attack of the Clones lives long in the minds of Star Wars fans, whereas conversely, his portrayal in The Clone Wars nails it. Well, at least by comparison.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Certified short person moment</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-24.png><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>One of the biggest moments in recent Star Wars history was the introduction of The Child, aka Grogu or Baby Yoda. As much as Disney has tried to stop fans calling him Baby Yoda, they’re fighting a losing battle online. The same size as a large rabbit, Grogu really is a classic short king.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Frankly, this is just the internet as a whole.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-23.png><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>Ever been in the midst of a hardcore argument with a random Redditor about the importance of Luke drinking green milk in The Last Jedi? Perhaps debated the true meaning of Christmas? Or even dared to say pineapple belongs on pizza? Then you’ve undoubtedly experienced something a tad similar to the classic retort of “no” or “ratio.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Heat me up before you go-go</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-22.png><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Kylo Ren is depicted as a brooding badass in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Wearing a cool mask, a slightly inconvenient cross-hilted lightsaber, and a fluffy black cape, he’s the most iconic character from the most recent films. But even he requires sustenance. Pizza, anyone?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Great Resignation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/C-2vsKMVwAEABqe.jpg><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Writing a CV is perhaps the most annoying and depressing part of trying to get a job. Do you sell yourself too much? Sound humble? Or put in that annoying fact about everyone on Earth being TIME‘s Person of the Year in the 2000s? But when you actually get the job, is that even safety?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The weather app blues</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Star-Wars-Memes.jpg><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Kylo became one of the most increasingly relatable characters in the galaxy after he rocked up to the remains of the second Death Star with absolutely no rain jacket nor buoy. Absolutely bucketing down with rain as he took on Rey Skywalker, it’s a shame the First Order doesn’t produce company rain jackets.</p><h2 id=h-have-you-heard-the-tragedy-of-darth-scroller-the-wise data-injectable=false>Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Scroller the Wise?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/d20.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>One of the greatest tragedies of the modern life is scrolling endlessly through memes, perhaps 20 or 30 minutes in, then accidentally shooting yourself back up to the top of the page. There is no word for this pain on WebMD, but we suggest “Post- Scroll Abyss.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>LEGO Star Wars is unmatched</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sub-buzz-19678-1493919271-3.png><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>If you didn’t grow up playing at least one of the LEGO Star Wars games, you must have had a miserable childhood. An absolute gem of a game, it’s amazing how far the series has come since. The Skywalker Saga released in 2022 to rave reviews, but nostalgia says nothing can top the 2005 effort.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Poor Rey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Star-Wars-Memes4-1.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Rey was unlucky, really, at the end of The Rise of Skywalker. She defeats the Sith, reclaims her own identity, and buries Luke’s lightsaber, symbolizing his return from whence he came. She reveals her yellow-bladed lightsaber: but for nothing. Until Disney gives us a Rey follow-up, the most that saber will get to do is chop wood outside a hut.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Now, for a meta meme from the writer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sub-buzz-20318-1493920049-1.png><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>There is no feeling more humbling than being in charge of a thousand-word article and slowly struggle to get any of your brain to produce words. If your high school and college years didn’t involve trying hard to make up space, then you must have powers that not even the dark lords of the Sith could muster.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXam8sXmQaWSmp6OperOxy5qrmpqcmnq0wMCrZLCZoqh6rrHMnqpmr5Wrsm6%2FxJ6laA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sharon-la-hechicera-htm.html><span>←</span><span>Sharon la Hechicera - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</span></a>
