We started talking more on the promotion thing,” Fassbender says. “So, yeah, it just sort of unfolded like that.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=632 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="michael fassbender GQ" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Fassbender was famously snubbed in the Best Actor in a Motion Picture category at the 84th Annual Academy Awards — a blow he didn’t anticipate.</p><p>“At the beginning people [say], ‘You’re going to be going to the Oscars,’ and you’re like, ‘Whatever, doesn’t matter, don’t think so.’ But after a while it does penetrate. After a while you’re like, ‘Anyway, so I’m going to the Oscars. . .’ And you start to believe it. And I did. I thought I was going. And then I found out I wasn’t and I was upset. I was very upset by it. The first reaction was, ‘What the f-ck?'”</p><p>The Prometheus actor adds: “It’s a vanity thing. It does become important to you. And it shouldn’t.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fassbender worries that his heavily publicized full-frontal nude scenes in Shame may have ruined his chances at Oscar gold.</p><p>“That peeing cost me an Oscar . . . After a certain point you worry that it kind of detracts from the movie. But there’s nothing I can do. I just have to laugh it off. I can. Pretty much,” he tells <a href=#>GQ</a>. “Because I take my work seriously but I can’t take myself too seriously. I’m in such a crazy privileged position. Sh-t, this is the pinnacle of the dream when I was 17. Nobody wants to hear really how difficult it is.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZOdrqa4jJ%2BYrKuSmrulsdFmpqmdnqh6tryMmpmoraRitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqvtcKoo55lkpq1or7InmRraGFnfnaBjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jeb-burton-related-to-jeff-burton-nephew-uncle.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jeb Burton Related To Jeff Burton?
