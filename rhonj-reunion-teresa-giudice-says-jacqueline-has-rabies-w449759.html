<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>'RHONJ' Reunion: Teresa Giudice Says Jacqueline Has 'Rabies'</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Not even a group hug can fix this friendship. During part 2 of&nbsp;<i>The Real Housewives of New Jersey’</i>s season 7 reunion on Sunday, November 13,&nbsp;<b><a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a></b> and <a href=#><b>Jacqueline Laurita</b></a> continued to be at each other’s throats. The Bravo series’ episode began with Teresa reiterating her belief that Jacqueline had played a role in getting her thrown in jail.</p><p>“You’re a f–king crazy bitch!” Teresa shouted at her former friend. To <b>Andy Cohen</b>, who asked Teresa to clarify her accusation, Teresa said, “I feel like she was definitely dabbling in it. She was speaking to people, getting information. Then maybe those certain people then went to the feds.”</p><p>For what it was worth, <b>Siggy Flicker </b>and <b>Dolores Catania</b> couldn’t believe Jacqueline would do something like that. “I’m friends with Jacqueline, and I’ve never seen anything but good come out of her. I only see her as a loyal person who wants to help,” Siggy said. Dolores added, “I don’t know her of doing the things that she’s being accused of.”</p><p>Jacqueline’s husband, Chris, then chimed in, admitting they had a “mutual friend” who had called him up because there had been a real estate dispute with <b>Joe Giudice</b>. According to Chris’ version of the story, he had tried to help Joe make a deal so there “wouldn’t be any problems,” but when he reached out, Joe effectively told Chris to tell their mutual friend to “go f–k himself.” At that point, Chris explained, he’d wanted “nothing to do with this.”</p><p><b>Melissa Goes After Jacqueline</b></p><p><b><a href=#>Melissa Gorga</a></b> then jumped in to defend Teresa and take Jacqueline down a few notches. “She sucks!” Melissa said as she pointed at Jacqueline. “She will tell all your secrets!” (ICYMI: Jacqueline had been busy insisting Melissa had gotten four nose jobs, which apparently Melissa didn’t want her daughter to know.) “Look at me in my eyes!” Melissa said to Siggy and Dolores. “I warned you first.” She then turned to Jacqueline and called her “disgusting.”</p><p>Later, when the nose job issue came up again, Melissa told Jacqueline she was a “s–t friend” and asked her how she lived with herself. “She’s a wolf in lamb’s clothing, but she has rabies,” Teresa added, prompting Andy to explain that the saying was actually a wolf in sheep’s clothing. “You are a low, dirty bitch!” Teresa added as Jacqueline shook her head in pity and anger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nj2-b623d1e6-cf86-4de5-8dbf-eeb61d12ef9d.jpg><p><b>Teresa Still Doesn’t Really Take Responsibility</b></p><p>Andy then shifted the conversation to what Teresa had learned in prison. She said she’d learned that not everyone in prison is a bad person. “I met a lot of wonderful women,” she explained, adding that she finally had come to terms with saying the word “prison,” which had been hard for her at first because that’s not how she thought of herself. She also reported that she had received massages from other female inmates but had not had any sexual encounters.</p><p>Pressed by the host about taking responsibility for her actions that had led her to prison in the first place, however, Teresa still didn’t seem to totally get it. “I know I’m not a bad person. I know I didn’t try to commit a crime,” she said. “The numbers that were on the paper were incorrect. I didn’t fill out that paper. … All I did was sign on the dotted line.” Andy didn’t press her beyond that, but it was pretty obvious this wasn’t what he was looking for her to say. “I wish everybody else in that room went away also,” she added. Andy nodded and moved the conversation along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nj3-75797247-30c7-4c98-811d-aace2bbd01e2.jpg><p><b>Teresa Gives an Update on Joe</b></p><p>Teresa also happily reported that her husband had lost an impressive 35 pounds since entering prison and reiterated her belief that he had not cheated on her while she was away. She didn’t believe the cheating rumors because no woman had any evidence to prove it.</p><p>“I know if I was with Joe Guidice, I would make sure I would get kissing pictures,” she reasoned. “I would make sure I would get pictures in bed.”</p><p>Andy then asked Teresa about the possibility that Joe could be deported when he got out of jail. An emotional Teresa didn’t say much, citing the fact that it was “a legal matter,” so she really was not at liberty to discuss it. “I guess we’ll deal with that when it comes,” she said. “I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s hard to blame her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nj4-6370de21-dac3-4026-ab54-52c8fdf24a48.jpg><p><b>Teresa and Jacqueline Get Emotional</b></p><p>To end the episode, Andy played a montage of clips from happier times in Teresa and Jacqueline’s friendship, which had both of the women near tears by the end.</p><p>“We both have said and done terrible things to each other,” Jacqueline said. “It’s like sisters.” Teresa said she didn’t want to fight with anyone like that but also insisted she’d never done anything to hurt Jacqueline “intentionally.” Indeed, they both seemed to soften up after that. “Just because I’m angry at someone doesn’t mean I don’t have compassion,” Jacqueline said, while Teresa admitted it was “not easy” watching Jacqueline’s struggles with Nicholas.</p><p>Even Melissa admitted, “I don’t like to see anybody hurt,” and praised Jacqueline for being “wonderful” with Nicholas. Dolores echoed that sentiment, noting, “Jacqueline has a much harder job than all of us and never complains.”</p><p>Siggy ended the get-together by basically forcing everyone to participate in a group hug. “We don’t have to be friends,” Jacqueline said to Teresa. “But I will never utter a bad word about you.”</p><p>Tell <i>Us</i>: Do you think Jacqueline will make good on that promise?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp56ferOx1KegqKZdqbKzsdKaZKChpZm2pLGMrJiyq12frqS91J6joqaVYrWiv4yrmJuhlah6uICTcm5ucV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-laroyce-hawkins-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Who is LaRoyce Hawkins wife?</span></a>
