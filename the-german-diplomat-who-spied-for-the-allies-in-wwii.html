First, he tried to arrange a trip to Switzerland under the guise of skiing in the Alps, but he was rejected, partly on the grounds of him not being a Nazi party member (per “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Spy the Nazis Missed</a>“). He was rejected twice more in his attempts a year later.</p><p>However, in Spring 1943, Kolbe found his opening. He came back into contact with one of his former <a href=# rel=noopener>Wandervogel colleagues</a>, Gertrud von Heimerdinger. Heimerdinger promised to secure Kolbe a diplomatic mission to Switzerland, and he immediately started collecting cables he was supposed to destroy (via “<a href=# rel=noopener>The Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich</a>“). That August, Kolbe finally made it to Bern with Heimerdinger’s help, and he immediately contacted his old friend, Kocherthaler, to help him get in touch with the Allies (via “Piercing the Reich”).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybrPEq6Sapl2ZtrG4zqaYrWWnnbxuv8%2BinJ1llqS%2FbsDHnmSapJyesrR5yKdksK%2BZnnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-5-best-mob-psycho-100-villains-ranked.html><span>←</span><span>The 5 best Mob Psycho 100 villains, ranked</span></a>
