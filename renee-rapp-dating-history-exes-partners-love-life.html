I don’t feel like I’ve been made to feel small or like I need to make myself smaller to make them feel comfortable.”</p><p>It’s been rumored that Reneé is <a href=#>dating <strong>Alissa Carrington</strong></a>.</p><h2>Who Is Reneé Rapp Dating?</h2><p>It appears that Reneé is keeping her current romance out of the public eye.</p><p>“I swore up and down I would never be in a public relationship and then I just found someone who I really loved and made me feel really safe and comfortable,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>People</a> in August 2023. “So, then I started posting with this person, and then it became a whole thing.

I don’t think that I had an amazing relationship to my queerness, but through playing Leighton, I feel like I’m being much more openly queer, because it is a public part of who I am, and I’m very proud of that.”</p><p>When asked how she would prefer to identify her sexuality in a November 2021 interview with <a href=#>Vulture</a>, Reneé replied with, “I usually just use the term queer. I’m 21, and there will be days that I go to my partner and be like, ‘We need to have a conversation because I think I’m this.’ And then I’ll come back and be like, ‘No, I’m this.’ It’s a queer, evolving story.”</p><p>Reneé noted in the same interview that she was grateful to be a part of a generation that has, “More grace about finding your identity and how these things change and loving that part of yourself.”</p><h2>Who Has Reneé Rapp Dated?</h2><p>She was linked to fellow Broadway star <a href=#><strong>Antonio Cipriano </strong></a>in&nbsp;2019, according to <a href=#>Broadway.com</a>. The two posted <a href=#>Instagram</a> photos of one another up <a href=#>until 2021</a>, which is when fans believe they might have broken up.
