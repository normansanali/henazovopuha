Like any overjoyed mother, Chrissy added the cutest caption, writing, “The hair. simple plan is shaking.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Chrissy Teigen/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live host, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Andy Cohen</a> was quick to congratulate the couple and point out the unmistakable resemblance, commenting, “He is both of you to a tee,” while another believed it was all John’s doing in Wren, writing, “OMG he looks more like John than John does.” A third added, “John’s face strikes again!!!!!♥️.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wren’s arrival comes within a year of Teigen and Legend giving birth to their daughter, Esti (one might call these two Irish twins). When <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chrissy was pregnant</a> with Esti, the couple was working with a surrogate who became pregnant with a boy. On June 19, the couple welcomed their baby boy, Wren into the world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After losing Jack, I didn't think I'd be able to carry any more babies on my own,” she wrote in the carousel post announcing the arrival of their newborn while opening up about the couple's traumatic 2020 miscarriage. “To be honest, I've personally blocked out a lot of my mindset during that time, but one clear memory is being surrounded by people who wanted to make sure I wouldn't go through that pain and loss again.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "At some point, early in our surrogacy journey, I came out of a therapy session, walked downstairs and said to John — I want to try to carry just one more time. If it doesn't work, we will be okay. We've already seen the worst. I promised I would be okay no matter what happened. I remember saying I just couldn't go on wondering my whole life if I should have tried again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Our hearts, and our home, are officially full," she concluded.
