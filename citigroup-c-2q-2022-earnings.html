That handily exceeded expectations for the quarter as analysts have been slashing earnings estimates for the industry in recent weeks.</p><p>Revenue rose a bigger-than-expected 11% in the quarter to $19.64 billion, more than $1 billion over estimates, as the bank reaped more interest income and saw strong results in its trading division and institutional services business.</p><p>“In a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results and we are in a strong position to weather uncertain times, given our liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels,” Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said in the release. Corporate cash management, Wall Street trading and consumer credit cards performed well in the quarter, she noted.</p><p>Having a low stock price hasn’t protected Citigroup from further declines this year. It’s the cheapest of the six biggest U.S. banks from a valuation perspective, having declined 27% this year. On Thursday, Citigroup shares hit a fresh 52-week low.</p><p>How will Fraser begin to turn the tide? Fraser has announced plans to exit retail banking markets outside the U.S. and set medium-term <a href=#>return targets</a> in March. But there are no easy answers.</p><p>Bank stocks have been hammered this year over concerns that the U.S. is facing a recession, which would lead to a surge in loan losses.&nbsp;Like the rest of the industry, Citigroup is also contending with a sharp decline in investment banking revenue, partly offset by an expected boost to trading results in the quarter.</p><p>On Thursday, bigger rival <a href=# rel=noopener>JPMorgan Chase</a> posted results that <a href=#>missed expectations</a> as it built reserves for bad loans, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Morgan Stanley</a> disappointed on a worse-than-expected <a href=#>slowdown</a> in investment banking fees.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Bank of America</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Goldman Sachs</a> are scheduled to report results on Monday.</p><p>This story is developing.
