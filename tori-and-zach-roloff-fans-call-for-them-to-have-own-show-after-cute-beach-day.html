After 16 years, there has been several spin-off programs, as well as 23 seasons. We watched as members of the Roloff family expanded their empires and made huge changes at the farm.</p><p>Fans were able to follow the Roloffs and their farm adventures. They also saw the youngsters grow into the adults they are today on the program.</p><p>A lot has changed in the show, as now Amy and Matt have gone their separate ways and found new partners. Their children – including Zach – Jeremy, Molly and Jacob are all making a life of their own.</p><p>Now, even though Zach and Tori still appear on the show from time to time, fans would love for them to have their own series.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH PREVIOUS SEASONS OF LITTLE PEOPLE BIG WORLD ON TLC</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a> AND <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqbmke9OoqaJlkaOxbsbAnJ9mqp%2BhvKeyjJ%2BYp6tdmK6tuIyfpqtlpJ2yrnnTqGShmaaaerDDzWaqoaenYq6nwMSrZJytpJp6o7HAnJ9mnJGu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-big-bang-theory-cast-start-of-their-careers-photos.html><span>←</span><span>What The Big Bang Theory cast looked like at the start of their careers</span></a>
