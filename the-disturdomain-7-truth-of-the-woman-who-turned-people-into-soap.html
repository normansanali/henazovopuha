She began to reason that by sending God a body, He would not take her son away. When an old widower came to Cianciulli looking for a husband, she made up a suitor waiting for her in Croatia, complete with fake love letters. When the woman was ready to leave, Cianciulli offered her a drink of drugged wine and killed the unconscious woman with an ax. She chopped the body into several pieces and got rid of her blood by mixing it into tea cakes, which she offered to the other women around town.&nbsp;</p><p>Cianciulli continued to kill, using fat from her victim's bodies to make soap, while still creating her macabre cakes and chocolates from their blood. A sister of her third victim was able to connect Cianciulli to the crime, and when the police threatened to investigate Giuseppe, she came clean, discussing her crimes with casual ease. Cianciulli showed little remorse for the lives she had taken and the neighbors who unwittingly ate human meat and blood because of her; all that mattered was that Giuseppe returned from the war alive, which he did.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk29wbWxfqbWmecOiqq2topm8rq3Ip5ZwZaSnwrW0jKidZqyYmnq4u8yapWavmKR6tcHRp5ydZaCavLG4xGagp6yfYsCwrc9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-staudinger.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Staudinger- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career, Boyfriend</span></a>
