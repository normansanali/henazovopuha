Last night he sadly passed away and lost his battle with&nbsp;<strong>stage 4 cancer</strong>. I’ll never forget the first day we met, I had no idea at the time that it was such a blessing that he was put into my life.</p><p>Daniel and I bonded instantly, and I can only count a few people on my right hand who I trust my life with, my heart, my secrets, and my insecurities. and he never judged me once.</p><p>It’s truly hard to fathom that this day is here, but I’ve never seen someone fight harder to LIVE. When he was diagnosed with cancer, he never let it stop him, and is the strongest person I think I’ve ever met.</p><p>I am so grateful and blessed to have traveled the world with him, performed on stage together in front of thousands of people, explore almost every state in America, and the whole time throughout my tumultuous career, he never switched up on me, and always had my back. He was fearless, ALWAYS himself, and was tough as nails.</p><p>Please send all of the positive energy and prayers you can to his family, they have truly suffered such a huge loss, losing someone so special. The pain of his passing is so vast, I’m truly heartbroken.</p><p>RIP Daniel Lucas Oxford</p><p>Daniel is also very forthcoming about his Cancer project on the web media front. Since approximately three years ago, Daniel has been battling stage 3 conal malignant tumor.</p><p>As was already reported, Lucas succumbed to stage 4 cancer after a protracted illness. He is the toughest guy anyone has ever thought of meeting, and despite being told that he had cancer, he never let that stop him.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
