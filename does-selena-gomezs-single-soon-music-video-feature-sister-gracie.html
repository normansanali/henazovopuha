“I love you, sissy. Never worry about boyfriends — at all,” says a young voice at the beginning of Gomez’s video, which dropped on Friday, August 25.
While fans were quick to assume the message comes from 9-year-old Gracie, the 31-year-old Only Murders in the Building star hasn’t confirmed whether her sister — who is the daughter of Gomez’s mom, Mandy Teefey, and stepdad Brian Teefey&nbsp; — is featured on the track."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
