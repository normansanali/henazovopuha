The suspects have been growing over the weeks, and although all signs are pointing to Lucas Horton's possible involvement in the murder, that may not be true. Some fans believe that characters such as Sarah Horton (<a href=#>Linsey Godfrey</a>), Kate Roberts (<a href=#>Lauren Koslow</a>), or Ava Vitali (<a href=#>Tamara Braun</a>) may even be involved in the crime.</p><p dir=ltr>This week, a brand new "Days of Our Lives" promo released on <a href=#>Twitter</a> has fans going wild. Spoilers for the upcoming episodes reveal that Lucas will undergo hypnosis in hopes of remembering what happened the night of Abigail's murder. In the preview, Lucas is seen at the DiMera mansion, but the clips appear to reveal that he's not the one who killed Abigail. However, it does look like Lucas may have seen the killer and could reveal a very shocking identity to Abigail's loved ones.</p><p dir=ltr>Fans immediately took to social media to share their thoughts on the new promo and name suspects. "Charlotte and Thomas did it," one fan <a href=#>wrote</a>, suggesting that Abigail's young children may have had a hand in her death. "I think it was Sarah Hallucinating," another <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "It's Philip," another <a href=#>commented</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Only time will tell who really killed Abigail, but "Days of Our Lives" fans are sure to be in for a wild ride as the mystery is unlocked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57mGxob2pnZMSpxYydmLKrXaSzbrvUq2SloaaawG6%2Fz6igpZ2iqHqprdWeZJ%2BZnqh6qMHErKqippdixKm7jKSgpaSVmXqirsigmKKkXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-robo-girl-the-masked-singer.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Robo Girl?
