The pair continued to hang out, from grabbing dinner in Los Angeles to joining Taggart’s Chainsmokers bandmate <strong>Alex Pall</strong> for a double date.</p><p>In July 2020, they <a href=#>made their relationship Instagram official</a>. The California native, 28, posted pictures of herself kissing the DJ, 31, at the time.</p><p>“So happy for you sis! Love you two together,” <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong> </a>commented on the social media upload, while <a href=#><strong>Sofia Richie</strong> </a>wrote, “Omg you lovebirds.”</p><p>Jeffries continued to keep their connection mostly under wraps, occasionally posting photos via social media at birthday parties and weddings.</p><p>She wished the Maine native a happy 31st birthday in January, gushing via Instagram: “You make this planet feel like home. Happy birthday I love you as much as pie and I’ll love you as long as pi continues. Wish I was saying this out loud so it would be punnier anyways can’t wait to do everything on earth with you.”</p><p>Jeffries previously told Us exclusively that her ideal man is “someone that’s generally a best friend and has similar interests.” She added in November 2018: “Someone who’s understanding of that is really important, and someone that I can learn from, because I always feel like, when you’re learning, you’re growing, and I don’t ever want to be like stagnant, so I think it’s really cool.”</p><p>Prior to her relationship with the Grammy winner, Jeffries dated <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> in 2018, as well as <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> on and off from 2014 to 2016. After the “Yummy” singer, 27, <a href=#>got engaged</a> to wife <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong> </a>(née Baldwin) in July 2018, <a href=#>Jeffries gushed exclusively to Us </a>about her ex’s proposal.</p><p>“I’m so happy,” she said the following month. “I think it’s so cool you get to be in a relationship with someone who is such a good friend of yours. Because it’s just hanging with your friend all day.”</p><p>While the actress didn’t have any “advice” for her former beau in August 2018, she noted that it was always a good idea to “marry your best friend.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for Taggart, he was linked to model <a href=#><strong>Meredith Mickelson</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Haley Rowe</strong></a> before Jeffries.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGjwaa4jKOcn56inrK0ecOrnLBlpJa0qK3RrWSsqJyewW6txa2cq2VhYsamrdFmm5qsmaO0cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carl-edwards-net-worth-7.html><span>←</span><span>Carl Edwards Net Worth</span></a>
