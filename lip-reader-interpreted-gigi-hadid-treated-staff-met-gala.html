The TikToker watches how Hadid interacts with these members of staff who are helping her, and she details some of the alleged things she says to them. These include, "OK, are we still going that way?," and "Giddy up, come on."</p><h2 id=how-does-gigi-hadid-treat-staff>How Does Gigi Hadid Treat Staff?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gigi-hadid-met-gala-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi Hadid has worked in the fashion industry for a long time, and she has enjoyed great success as a model. Despite her star status, she still appears to be incredibly humble and kind. <strong>In the video, she is seen thanking the men who are helping her move around in her Thom Browne gown</strong> (the dress code of this year's Met Gala was Garden of Time). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some of the other things she says</a> in the short clip include, "Oh wait, guys, you're in my shot," and "One second, sorry." She can also be seen smiling and laughing.</p><p>In the video, tismejackie captioned it with a disclaimer. She wrote, "Lip reading is not a reliable form of communication; all statements are alleged." Still, her video is racking up the likes and has received many comments discussing Hadid and her behavior. Comments on the post include, "She seems stressed, but she's still being nice," "Gigi and Bella are known for being absolutely amazing to anyone working for them," and "She was actually the sweetest, I think."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other fans also praised TikToker tismejackie for her work and they loved Hadid's custom-made dress. "My most favorite dress from the Met Gala. Please keep lip reading — love this," one comment reads. Another adds, "I'm obsessed with your lip-readings. "I love this, please never stop," a TikTok user commented.</p><h2 id=why-was-gigi-hadid-39-s-dress-so-difficult-to-walk-in>Why Was Gigi Hadid's Dress So Difficult To Walk In?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gigi-hadid-met-gala-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one can say that Gigi Hadid did not look gorgeous when she attended the Met Gala this year. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Her choice of dress</a> was also incredibly detailed, as her stylist, Mimi Cuttrell, shared.</p><p>"Gigi wears a shiny white micro bugle bead corset dress with 3D yellow rose embroidered detail," Cuttrell wrote, per Elle. "Suspended from the exaggerated hip dress is a draped white silk moiré tailored jacket with black duchess satin tipping. An array of 3D yellow roses, green vines, and thorns are appliqued throughout. Embroidery techniques and components include bullion, crystals, silk satin stitch, and lovebird beads."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/tiktoker-video-about-jelly-roll.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="TikToker Explains Why Jelly Roll Is Being Sued By A Wedding Band Over His Name">TikToker Explains Why Jelly Roll Is Being Sued By A Wedding Band Over His Name</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jelly Roll is being sued for trademark infringement and his fans think the lawsuit is ridiculous and bound to be thrown out.</p><p>She continued, "The white dress has 2,800,000 micro bugle beads, and it took twenty people 5,000 hours to embroider the dress. The skirt took forty people a total of 8,500 hours to embroider. Seventy people were involved in the making of this dress." With this in mind, it's maybe even more <strong>obvious why she did not want to get the dress ruined and needed so many people to help her navigate the red carpet and her photo shoot</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqhdp7KisMSrZKKmpJq%2Fsb7ErZydZZeetKp5x5qbopxdqb%2BmrdOem2arpJazp3nMnqtmn5GhrnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wrestlemania-role-elias-revealed.html><span>←</span><span>WrestleMania Role for Elias Revealed</span></a>
