She shared an on-screen kiss with Davidson during a skit in which they played Disney’s Aladdin and Princess Jasmine.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_58>The reality star had met Davidson before (the comedian has shared a story about going to dinner with Kid Cudi, only to have Timothee Chalamet, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian West show up unexpectedly – and Davidson ended up footing the bill). But she was single and in the process of divorcing Kanye West when she hosted SNL.</p><p id=par-4_47>Another skit was a spoof of the popular competition reality show <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>. Kardashian West played the star looking for love amongst a group of eligible men. Some of the famous faces SNL used as pretend contestants were <a href=#>John Cena</a>, Chase Crawford, Blake Griffin, and Tyler Cameron.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_34>Chris Rock was also in the group of “bachelors,” and he recently opened up about what it was like to appear on the show the night that Davidson and Kardashian West started their romance.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-chris-rock-shared-his-thoughts-from-the-night-kim-kardashian-west-and-pete-davidson-met-on-saturday-night-live><strong>Chris Rock shared his thoughts from the night Kim Kardashian West and Pete Davidson met on ‘Saturday Night Live’&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=par-6_38>Chris Rock recently opened up about the night he appeared on SNL with Kim Kardashian West and Pete Davidson. He got candid during a conversation for the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fly on the Wall with Dana Carvey and David Spade</a>” podcast.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_25>The comedian hinted that he had a feeling the reality star might actually end up with one of the guys from her pretend Bachelorette crew.</p><p id=par-8_49>“So I’m at the Kim show – by the way, Kim was incredibly funny, right? – and I’m sitting backstage, and I was like, ‘Who’s it gonna be?’” Rock joked. “Because, like, it’s not me, she probably met Blake Griffin already. You know, maybe Pete. This might be it.”</p><p id=par-9_21>Pete wasn’t in the group of fake contestants, but Rock implied that he still sensed some chemistry between the two stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_33>When asked why he didn’t go after Kardashian West himself, Rock answered, “I’m more of a Khloé guy,” referencing Kardashian West’s younger sister. “Plus, I’m friends with Kanye; that would’ve been too weird.”</p><p id=par-11_23>“They’re both lovely people, by the way,” Rock remarked. “So, I wish them well.” He also said of Davidson, “He’s really tall, too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Chris-Rock.jpg><p id=par-12_33>Chris Rock mentioned that he is friends with Kanye West, who is dating actor Julia Fox while divorcing Kim Kardashian West. The podcast hosts asked Rock what West is like in real life.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_23>“He’s an eccentric guy, you know?” the comedian answered. “With Kanye, I always go, ‘Is he worth it?’ and it’s like, ‘So far!’”</p><p id=par-14_35>Rock also referenced West’s work as a musician and fashion designer. “Just as an artist, it’s like he puts you through a lot, but you’re like, ‘Okay, the record’s pretty great! I love these sneakers!’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwqb7IrGSrp5OgerS0wKucrGWYlr2xsc2em2ajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu27DxKyrZqWVqXqxsdOeZJ2Zpp6xtLvNZqqnpF6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-evans-and-alba-baptistas-relationship-timeline.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Evans and Alba Baptistas Relationship Timeline</span></a>
