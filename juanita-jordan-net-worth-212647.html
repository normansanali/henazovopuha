The pair began dating, and became engaged in 1987, but subsequently broke off the engagement. They eventually married in 1989. The couple went on to have three children, two sons and a daughter, before filing for divorce in 2002. They then attempted to reconcile, but eventually chose to go their separate ways amicably in 2006. Juanita Jordan received the family's massive compound as part of the divorce settlement, which was valued at $168 million. It was the largest celebrity divorce settlement ever at the time, though it has since been eclipsed. Recently, she has appeared in the headlines again, when her daughter was preparing for college, and her ex-husband became engaged. Juanita and Michael Jordan's children are son Jeffrey Michael Jordan born in 1988, son Marcus James Jordan born in 1990, and daughter Jasmine Mickael Jordan born in 1992.
