<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>What happend to Yadira Calito?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>The incident, which occurred around 9:10 a.m. on Wednesday, sent shockwaves through the community and prompted an ongoing investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. The victim, whose identity was officially withheld by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner as of Tuesday morning, was reportedly Yadira Calito, a beloved nanny who worked for singer Katharine McPhee.</span></p><p><span>Calito tragically lost her life in the horrifying incident, leaving behind a devastated family and a community mourning her loss. According to authorities, a 2017 Toyota RAV4 was being driven into the dealership when it inexplicably accelerated, crashing into several individuals who were inside the dealership’s reception area.</span></p><p><span>The force of the collision caused significant damage and injuries to the victims. Two employees, a 23-year-old man and a 35-year-old man, sustained non-life-threatening injuries and were expected to recover. The customer, tragically identified as Yadira Calito, succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced deceased at the hospital.</span></p><p><span>The 84-year-old driver of the Toyota RAV4, a resident of Mission Hills, emerged unscathed from the incident. As the LAPD continues its investigation, no arrests have been made at this time. The heart-wrenching news reached singer Katharine McPhee, who was on tour in Asia with her husband, David Foster.</span></p><p><span>The loss of their nanny prompted McPhee to announce on Instagram that she would be cutting the tour short due to the “horrible tragedy” that had struck their family. The devastating incident highlights the fragility of life and the unexpectedness of tragedy that can occur in even the most ordinary of moments.</span></p><p><span>As the investigation continues, the Mission Hills community comes together to support each other and remember the life of Yadira Calito, a cherished nanny who brought love and care to the lives of those she touched. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cherishing every moment and valuing the people who make a positive impact on our lives.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaGuucXLmqWdq16YvK561admspmUnr%2BiecKao6Ksn2K8o7XTrpirsV2staLAjKGYqaiVo7FuwM5msJqcmaeubq%2FApaCtp18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-movies-to-watch-with-your-parents-html.html><span>←</span><span>The 59 Best Movies to Watch With Your Parents During Quarantine</span></a>
