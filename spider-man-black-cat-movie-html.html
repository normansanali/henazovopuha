There have always been whispers of a Black Cat film in development at Sony. Movie bosses went over various interpretations of the Spider-Man character, but over the years the idea was plagued by setbacks. The studio passed on various scripts, including the well-publicized team up with Silver Sable."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Movie bosses went over various interpretations of the Spider-Man character, but over the years the idea was plagued by setbacks. The studio passed on various scripts, including the well-publicized team up with Silver Sable. So Black Cat never made it to the big screen until now.</p><p>According to an exclusive report by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That Hashtag Show</a>, Sony executives are toying with the idea of a Black Cat movie once more. The latest script offering was allegedly created by an indie writer-director who had an excellent 2017 debut with even more success in 2019.</p><p>The film will reportedly be an origin story for the Spider-Man character, following Felicia Hardy’s time with her father Walter. After he disappears, she will be forced to fend for herself and ultimately discover a much larger conspiracy at work. The primary antagonist is said to be Chameleon, with Blaze as an Enforcer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/black-cat-comic-900x450.jpg><p>The publication also states that some elements of the original story may change as the film is an adaptation and not a replica of the comic book character. The project is still in the early stages of development but the studio is said to have a few actors in mind for specific roles. For the lead, Sony is interested in bringing back Felicity Jones. But there won’t be a tangible connection to The Amazing Spider-Man series and this will act as a standalone project for the time being.</p><p>Created by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marv Wolfman</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Cockrum</a>, Black Cat first appeared in 1979’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;#194. Throughout her history, Felicia Hardy has been an enemy, love interest, and ally of the famous web-slinger.</p><p>After suffering a traumatic experience as a college freshman, Felicia trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics. She ultimately decides to follow in her father’s cat burglar footsteps and creates a secret identity as Black Cat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Marvel-Black-Cat-900x450.jpg><p>Although she was originally depicted as a supervillain and adversary of Spider-Man, over time the pair fell in love, motivating her to become his partner and somewhat of an antihero. Like most relationships, however, things get complicated after Black Cat is only attracted to Spider-Man and not Peter Parker. After their break up the pair remained friends and allies for years, until Black Cat eventually returned to her criminal ways.</p><p>While nothing has been officially confirmed yet, Back Cat could be an interesting addition to the on-screen roster of Marvel superheroes. If Sony wants to capitalize on the character before fan interest fades we may get an announcement sooner rather than later.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans can catch up with the current Spider-Man, Tom Holland in Marvel’s <a href=#>latest offering</a> Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/spider-man-no-way-home-900x506.jpg><p>Directed by Jon Watts, Spider-Man: No Way Home also stars Zendaya as MJ, Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, and Jamie Foxx as Electro.</p><p><a href=#>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> arrives in theaters on December 17, 2021.
