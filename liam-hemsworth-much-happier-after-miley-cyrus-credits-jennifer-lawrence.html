Over the last five years I’ve learned so much. The first few years in LA were really tough and scary, but I had to figure things out for myself.”</p><p>It’s been two months since Miley and Liam’s split in the wake of cheating rumors. Hemsworth explained how he remained grounded during the intense media storm that erupted when the story broke:</p><p>“What I always keep in mind is that I know what the truth is and that’s all that matters. I know I’m a good person and these days I feel like I’m more centered and grounded than I’ve ever been.”</p><p>Along with reading “a lot of zen books,” kickboxing and surfing, Hemsworth credits his affable and infectious Hunger Games costar Jennifer Lawrence with helping him to remember to live in the present:</p><p>“For a few years I went down a path where I forgot to be in the moment and enjoy the moment. But being around someone like Jen, who is so honest and laughs all day long, I am forced to be in the right now. I’m much happier.”</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async title=Liam-and-Jennifer alt=Liam-and-Jennifer src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Liam-and-Jennifer.jpg width=490 height=548 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><strong>Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence have a little twerk-free dancing fun during the New York premiere of Catching Fire on Wednesday (11/20/13).</strong></p><p>A couple of weeks back, Lawrence <a href=#>made headlines</a> when she addressed the sexualized image of many young pop stars, directly citing a diminutive dancing performance by Miley:</p><p>“It’s just kind of a part of this world. It’s a part of the entertainment industry that sells. Sex sells and for some disgusting reason, young sex sells even more. Everybody has kind of got their own path and their own way of finding themselves and for some people, that’s how they feel best, that’s how they feel sexy, that’s how they want to perform.<a href=#> Twerking with a dwarf</a> … I’m not by any means … I’m just saying, to each their own.”</p><p>Liam’s older brother and star of Thor, Chris Hemsworth, applauded his sibling’s ability to keep outside distractions at bay:</p><p>“I am far more sensitive to that stuff and would probably take it more personally. My No. 1 rule is don’t Google yourself. But Liam can just close the door and go `Yeah, whatever.’ I admire that.”</p><p>Zen, kickboxing, surfing and hanging with J-Law sounds like a pretty darn good recipe for any young man looking to recalibrate his groove.</p><p><br><br></p><a title="website statistics" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c.statcounter.com/9009525/0/cfe375c3/1/ alt="website statistics" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p><br></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMdmpK6bmGK1orzPopyrZZGbwaa%2BjKagpZ2pYrC6vtSsZJyqlZm2tb%2BMo5ynppmbsrN5y5quq52emLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lenovo-thinkpad-x250.html><span>←</span><span>Lenovo ThinkPad X250</span></a>
