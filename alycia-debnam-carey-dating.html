I always have, I still do,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a> in 2017. “I find it a very hard medium for me to communicate on … It’s not the entire truth, either. Everything you see, it’s always a version of everything or it’s somehow manipulated to look a certain way.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue Australia</a> that same year, Alycia said she rarely updates her social media accounts “because as a person, you know, you’re not just a brand, and you’re not a commodity — you choose what you want to be.”</p><p>So fans may not know much about Alycia’s dating history, as you’ll see below, but the Aussie actress has given glimpses into her offscreen life over the years…</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alycia grew up in Sydney and studied classical percussion.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Alycia was born and raised in Sydney, Australia, and she attended performing arts school down under. “That [school] facilitated my creativity, though I ended up going in a more musical direction,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Interview</a> in 2016.</p><p>In fact, Alycia studied classical percussion for a decade, as she revealed to the magazine. “At one point I was thinking about going to the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, but then I realized it’s actually not what I wanted to do,” she said.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She’s been acting on screen for nearly 20 years — and she almost played Carrie Bradshaw.</h2><p>Alycia’s first screen credit is the 2003 short film Martha’s New Coat. And after other small roles, she landed a part in Into the Storm, a 2014 disaster film. That same year, she started starring in dystopian CW drama <a href=#>The 100</a>, her breakout gig. And soon she started pulling double duty, filming The 100 and Fear the Walking Dead simultaneously.</p><p>She told Vogue Australia that she auditioned to play a young Carrie Bradshaw in The CW’s <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> prequel series, <a href=#>The Carrie Diaries</a>, a role that went to AnnaSophia Robb: “I like that I didn’t do it, because when I was younger, I could get that white-knuckle grip of holding onto an idea and not wanting to let it go, but the moment I started to let go and seeing that there are no rules, there’s more flexibility and openness and knowing that if you follow something, it creates its own path.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alycia is excited for new creative horizons.</h2><p>Last year, Alycia revealed her career ambitions to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose Inc</a>, saying that she has started writing “a little bit” and that she wants to “start dipping [her] toe in directing.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And after playing Lexa on The 100 and Alicia on Fear the Walking Dead, Alycia is eager to branch out of post-apocalyptic TV. “I’d love to try something new, like rom-coms or period pieces — something just completely different from what I’ve been doing for a really long time, so I think it’s a very exciting new chapter for me and that’s really exciting to look forward to,” she said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She appears to be single.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who’s Dated Who</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FamousFix</a>, two websites that track celebrity relationships, report that Alycia is currently single. Both sites also report that Alycia was in a relationship with someone named Marcus Castrus. But details about that reported romance are sketchy — and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some websites</a> erroneously label photos of Alycia’s Into the Storm costar Max Deacon as photos of Marcus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrm6r8iaZJ2dkqOurnnCmqmesV2ZrrW1zaA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hp-phoenix-h91120t-system-review-hp-gaming-desktop-round-two-with-tahiti-and-ivy-bridge.html><span>←</span><span>HP's Gaming Desktop Round Two with Tahiti and Ivy Bridge</span></a>
