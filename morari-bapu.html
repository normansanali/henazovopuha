He said,</li></ul><p>Politicians mostly resort to&nbsp;‘saam, daam, dand, bhed’&nbsp;(carrot, stick, bargain, divide). But nobody can question the patriotism (rashtra-bhakti) of our Prime Minister. Much good work has been done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, but it is difficult to fulfill the demands of all. I am not a politician to tell people whom to vote. It is for the voters to listen to their own conscience and vote for whom they prefer.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=References></span>References<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul class=wpusm_ref_ol><li id=refid_1><a href=# class=jump_ref>1</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Google Books</a></li><li id=refid_2><a href=# class=jump_ref>2</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Google Books</a></li><li id=refid_3><a href=# class=jump_ref>3</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Bhaskar</a></li><li id=refid_4><a href=# class=jump_ref>4</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Janta Ka Reporter</a></li><li id=refid_5><a href=# class=jump_ref>5</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>BBC</a></li><li id=refid_6><a href=# class=jump_ref>6</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Jagran</a></li><li id=refid_7><a href=# class=jump_ref>7</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>YouTube</a></li><li id=refid_8><a href=# class=jump_ref>8</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>India Today</a></li><li id=refid_9><a href=# class=jump_ref>9</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Mangalore Today</a></li><li id=refid_10><a href=# class=jump_ref>10</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Wikipedia</a></li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Giani Harpreet Singh (Akal Takht Chief) Wiki, Age, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Giani Harpreet Singh (Akal Takht Chief) Wiki, Age, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Wiki, Age, Death, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Radhi Devlukia Shetty (Jay Shetty’s Wife) Age, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Radhi Devlukia Shetty (Jay Shetty’s Wife) Age, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Dadi Janki (Brahma Kumari) Wiki, Age, Death, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Dadi Janki (Brahma Kumari) Wiki, Age, Death, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC5zquYq6Fdl66xwY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-jenner-after-party-oscars-2020.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner Shows Off Two Dresses at the 2020 Oscars After-Party</span></a>
