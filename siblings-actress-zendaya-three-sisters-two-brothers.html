The Swag It Out singer has five half-siblings from her father’s side, Kazembe Ajamu, and several nieces and nephews as well. Likewise, Zendaya spends most of her time with her family and has a strong and loving bond with her half-siblings and the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Zendayas-family.jpg><p>The <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Stoermer-Coleman siblings</a> like keeping their private lifestyle under the radar, despite having a super famous sister with millions of followers. Furthermore, the despise for media interventions and followers have kept the siblings away from social media, and none of the siblings is on social media.</p><p>Zendaya’s brothers and sisters have never appeared in front of any public events or shows for the famous actress except her parents. But Zendaya frequently keeps on posting photos of her half-siblings and families.

Although she has to keep on running from set to set to film her series or movies, she takes out time out of her busy schedule to spend time with her half-siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Auntie_Zendaya_Is_Younger_Than_Her_Nieces></span>Auntie Zendaya Is Younger Than Her Nieces<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zendaya was born <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">as an auntie</a> since her older siblings already had children when she was born. The stunning Zendaya is a year younger than her niece, <strong>Ezenia Coleman</strong>, who is also one of her closest friends. In an interview with Complex, Zendaya confessed that her then-20 years old niece was the closest person to her.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Zendaya</a> (@zendaya) on Mar 11, 2017 at 11:18pm PST</p><p>One of Zendaya’s half-sibling lives in L.A. with her daughters, including Ezenia and her husband.
