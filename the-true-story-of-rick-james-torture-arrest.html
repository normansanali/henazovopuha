The singer threatened Alley with a gun, accusing her of stealing his drugs. He said if she tried to leave, he’d kill her (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Far Out</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>At this point, Jame and Hijazi allegedly tied Alley naked to a chair (via the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles times</a>). Over several days, Alley was burnt over 20 times with the hot end of their crack pipe (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>another posting by Far Out</a>). A day in to the forcible imprisonment, James made Alley engage in sex acts while he watched. They also forced the victim to smoke crack cocaine.</p><p>On July 17, when James untied Alley, she fled and eventually made it to Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for treatment. After hearing the allegations, authorities issued warrants for the arrest of James and Hijazi.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
