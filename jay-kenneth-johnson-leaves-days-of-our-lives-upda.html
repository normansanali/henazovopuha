The bad news is the show is already losing some of it’s cast.</p><p>Soaps.com just learned that Jay Kenneth Johnson (Philip) has left the show after his contract negotiations broke down. Since <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Days</strong></a> was renewed, it was stipulated some major changes would have to be made and actors being axed or asked to take pay cuts was apparently part of that. We don’t know for sure why Johnson has left the show, but word is <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Days</strong></a> is looking to recast the role.</p><p>Johnson played Philip from 1999 – 2002 and then returned in January 2007 to reprise the role of Victor and Kate’s son. Although successful in business, Philip has never really been lucky in love. Since Jay’s return, Philip has had flings and flirtations with Belle, Chloe and Morgan, but none of those relationships really took off. He’s been hanging out with Stephanie lately, leading us to wonder if she will be his next romantic hopeful, but alas, it will apparently have to be executed with another actor.</p><p>Soaps.com is sad to see Jay leave <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Days</strong></a>, but wish him well on his future endeavors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOp5ywq19nhXmEjqOYsmWbmruvsdOhZKOnmKPAsLqMpZyarpWoeqWt2KxkqJ5dpMKzecuirZ6rXaq9pa2O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./i-started-singing-in-church-sinach-used-to-carry-me-when-i-was-little-patoranking.html><span>←</span><span>I Started Singing In Church, Sinach Used To Carry Me When I Was Little- Patoranking</span></a>
