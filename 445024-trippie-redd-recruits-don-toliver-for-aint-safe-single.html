His four singles so far in 2022 have seen him work with his trademark styles: <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">acoustic ballads, melodic emo rap</a>, hard-hitting trap, and his newest track "Ain't Safe" brings psychedelic vibes into the mix. Assisted by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Don Toliver</a>, Trippie taps into his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Travis Scott</a> influences on this track and completes a general picture of his artistry with his singles this year.</p><p>Rob Kim/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Production-wise, "Ain't Safe" borrows heavily from the wave of psychedelic trap and melodic song structures and verses that Don has helped establish as an influential movement in hip-hop and popular music at large. It's nothing new at this point, but the graceful piano melodies and dense ad-libs make for a fun atmosphere to match the percussion. It's the type of beat that isn't hot on impact, with its bouncy bass hits and understated hi-hats and snares, but it works engagingly as a dreamy combo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Don Toliver opens the track with a catchy and tone-setting verse that outlines its lyrical topics. It ain't safe out there for his enemies, he's moving around with ease, he's meeting women over the world, and he stays strapped with .40s and Oxycontin. His voice is always a winner for tracks like these, especially when it's paired with a dynamic flow. In contrast to Trippie, he actually comes across as the more relaxed and laidback part of the song, and it's the track's catchiest moment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The "Miss The Rage" star doesn't slouch on his track, though. He expands on a lot of the same flexes and mindsets that Don started the track with, but with a more powerful vocal performance. Trippie slides in between snarls, soaring yells, and fast flows with ease. Much like Don Toliver, the 23-year-old's voice has always been one of the most interesting and idiosyncratic elements of his artistry, and to hear two imaginative vocalists together makes for some compelling ear candy.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Ain't Safe" follows three other singles this year in anticipation of Trippie's next album, A Love Letter To You 5. It's yet to come, but he's already said <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">it's his best body of work to date</a>. He's said that it won't be experimental like other projects of his, so it makes sense that these singles have all seen him tap into his most popular musical excursions.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Trippie has shown his big artistic personalities with all his 2022 singles, whether it's the trap banger "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Big 14</a>" or the emo-inspired dual release First Draft. This year's even seen him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">enter the anime world with a Boondocks producer</a>, so stay tuned to HotNewHipHop to see what other magic Trippie Redd has in store for fans.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can check out "Ain't Safe" featuring Don Toliver on your preferred streaming service, and check out some quotable lyrics below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Quotable Lyrics</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You know this like risky (Yeah)<br>Try me, b***h, I'll spray 'til it's empty (Grr, baow)<br>Purple in my cup, I feel like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pimp C</a> (Swear)<br>Keep some n***as 'round me down to fall and catch a case&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkaYJxfpNmq6uhoKW2pnnRnpudZaKasLPByK2qZpyfo3q1u8uirZ6qXZu8s3nAoqWtZaOWs6Z50qKloKSV</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./portland-dog-poop-bomb.html><span>←</span><span>The Dog Poop Bomber Blew Up A Stool-Filled Toolbox To Prank His Friend</span></a>
