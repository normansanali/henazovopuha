The anime was announced last December and premiered earlier today in Japan. Naturally, a large portion of its fans are scattered around the globe, and anticipation is building as they search for ways to stream the anime.</p><h2 id=h-where-to-watch-pokemon-horizons-the-series data-injectable=false>Where to watch Pokémon Horizons: The Series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>At the time of writing, the Pokémon Horizons episodes are only been aired on a Japanese broadcasting network, TV Tokyo. This means that, for now, there is no way for international fans to watch the anime legally — however, there’s still hope for them. In the past, Netflix has been a great source of Pokémon content, with episodes typically hitting the streaming platform in batches a few months after their premiere in Japan.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>All that said, it’s worth noting that there hasn’t been an official confirmation from Netflix or the series’ animation studio. In fact, an international release date has not even been announced, meaning that, currently, this is merely speculation. Pokémon fans will have to await further information to know when and where to watch the newest installment of the franchise, which will likely take a while.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>For now, those who are not yet caught up with recent releases can stream Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBlpKR6uK3TnJ9mrJiaerG7yp6kqKZdlruqucRmp6ijlaK8r3nHqKmisp%2BjwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./giselle-guilmette-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-216414-html.html><span>←</span><span>Giselle Guilmette Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
