She teamed her prom dress with pink makeup that matched her manicure too.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Noel Vasquez/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also showed love to her voluminous wig on Instagram, writing, "If y'all ain't booking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@jhanaecoleman</a> then what are you doing ? ü§© she did tf outta my sh-t! wig from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>@glamxtencollection</a> ‚ù§Ô∏è."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For fans who've been following the teen since her younger years, the flashy ensemble may have looked familiar, drawing similarities to the costumes she used to wear on TLC's pageantry series Toddlers & Tiaras and her spinoff show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, both of which skyrocketed Thompson into childhood stardom.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Thompson, though, has been navigating her style with a more mature outlook.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At 15, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>debuted a whole new look</a> while fronting a spread for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Teen Vogue</a> in 2021. The editorial photo shoot showcased Thompson in spunky yet grown-up looks: she posed in a checkered sequin dress, as well as a sophisticated trench coat with two-toned stockings. She also rocked a neon green tulle ball gown for a stunning portrait.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And in most of the photos, Thompson posed with barely any makeup on, showcasing her natural beauty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I guess people still expect me to be little Honey Boo Boo, and I'm not anymore," she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Teen Vogue</a> at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqGmp52pYq%2Bwu4ybpqhlkaGur62MrZ%2BopaCovK951p6Yq6tdpbavt4ypqailXZm%2Fpr%2FSZqqipZmhrrN5z5qenpmeqXqtu86kqmaomKTBsL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ghostemane.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Ghostemane Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
