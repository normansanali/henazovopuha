She is an archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew, having the powers of &nbsp;Hana Hana Devil Fruit, which allows her to regenerate any parts of her body or the entire body. In One Piece, the character also caters to the role of a mother for the crew because of her calm and collected demeanor, which necessitates the casting of someone mature in Netflix’s One Piece Live Action Season 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Live-Action-Season-2-1.jpg><p>Netflix has done a brilliant job with casting in One Piece Live Action Season 1 and has been praised well by the fandom. There have been several potential fits for the character <a href=#>Nico Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2</a>. Out of them, rumors are surrounding that three actresses are being scrutinized for the final call.</p><p lang=es dir=ltr><a href=# rel=noopener>@bymoonlightea</a> anya chalotra for NICO ROBIN <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/57Q8iX2oP5</a></p><p>— onepiecenewsalerts – On IG (@Z_OPNA) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 28, 2021</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anya_Chalotra_to_be_a_Part_of_One_Piece_Live_Action_Season_2_Cast></span>Anya Chalotra to be a Part of One Piece Live Action Season 2 Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Anya Chalotra is best known for her role in Witcher as the sorceress <strong>Yennefer of Vengerberg</strong>. She started her television career in 2018 with Netflix’s drama series <strong>“Wanderlust.”</strong> She is also known for her roles in “The ABC Murders” and a YouTube animated science fiction, <strong>“Sherwood.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Live-Action-Season-2-3.jpg><p>Anya Chalotra is recognized for her flexibility, emotional spectrum, and comprehension of the character she is playing. Her physical features, such as her dark hair, height, and slender body, are comparable to Nico Robin’s for One Piece Live Action Season 2. This is why the Witcher actress could be one of the perfect fits for the character of Nico Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idk if it's been said but I could see Millie Brady playing Nico Robin for the one piece live action lolol <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/MbBLPBJ17l</a></p><p>— ナミが大好き ☁️⚡️ (@skytopiaa) <a href=# rel=noopener>April 2, 2022</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Millie_Brady_to_be_a_Part_of_Straw_Hat_Pirates_Crew></span>Millie Brady to be a Part of Straw Hat Pirates Crew<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A budding English actress, recognized for her roles in <strong>Mr Selfridge</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>The Queen’s Gambit</strong>, and&nbsp;T<strong>he Last Kingdom</strong>, could be an ultimate choice for Netflix’s One Piece Live Action Season 2. Being a relatively fresh face, Brady has garnered enough attention and has sealed her place as one of the rising stars in the industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Live-Action-Season-2-4.jpg><p>Her outstanding performance in complex characters, such as <strong>Lady Aethelflaed</strong> in <strong>The Last Kingdom</strong>, has made her popular among critics. Millie Brady’s choice of roles for female characters portraying strong attitudes and performing them accurately could make her a potential choice for <a href=#>Nico Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2</a>.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Erin Maloney would be auditioning for the role of Nico Robin in One Piece Season 2 ‼️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vyn1J7MKP2</a></p><p>— One Piece Daily (@opdaiIy) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 27, 2023</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Erin_Maloney_Joins_the_Cast_of_One_Piece_Live_Action_Season_2></span>Erin Maloney Joins the Cast of One Piece Live Action Season 2<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Erin Maloney is a budding American actress/model who appears to be fascinated with the One Piece series. The model/actress currently holds no notable experiences other than a commercial appearance. However, due to her strong likeness to Nico Robin and her innate love for anime, she might be another great candidate for the character of <a href=#>Nico Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Live-Action-Season-2-5.jpg><p>One Piece showrunner Matt Owens has started following Erin Maloney, which has sparked the rumor of her being cast as Nicco Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2. Matt Owens has earlier followed Emily Rudd, and now fans of One Piece know her as Nami in the One Piece Live Action series.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Final_Thoughts></span>Final Thoughts:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Netflix has done a brilliant casting with One Piece Live Action Season 1. Fans were impressed by how thoroughly Netflix has tried to match the characters from the One Piece manga series to One Piece Live Action Season 1. With the help of Eiichiro Oda, the vision for the characters was so much to the point that it has raised further expectations for One Piece Live Action Season 2. So, who will ultimately bag the role of Nico Robin in One Piece Live Action Season 2?</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/Ades3pQbeh8/hqdefault.jpg alt="YouTube video" width=480 height=360 data-pin-nopin=true nopin=nopin style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXPraarp16YvK57z2ilnqyWoba5ec6nnGaomZqwpnnLoq2eZZGYwaq7zWaqnpmjpLtufoygnK2rXZZ6r7HWZpqaq6Riuqa5wZ6paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-trainor-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Trainor Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</span></a>
