I got the call at midnight because it was a decision that had been made in LA, so it was on LA time, and so I was already asleep and I didn't want to wake up [my girlfriend's] housemate.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUMYeWyQFAZk data-wc=84>"So I was in a robe in the corridor and I remember being like, 'These things go either way, don't feel sorry for me, don't pity me, I don't want any of that, it's probably not going to work out'. And then I came back like 'Oh my god I don't know what's just happened'. She said, 'You've got to do something to celebrate', and the only place was the local snooker club so we went and played snooker and that's how we celebrated."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcG5vaWx8ssHEnqVmm5iWv627062cZquRonqkuMSmpJ6spGKyr7PAoJymnZ6perixw52gp59dma6vrdGoqp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1296761-paul-heyman-rock-vs-roman-reigns-fantasies.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Heyman: Thoughts Of The Rock vs. Roman Reigns Are Masturbatory Fantasies Until Rock Puts</span></a>
