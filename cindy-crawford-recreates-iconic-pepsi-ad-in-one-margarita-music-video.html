In the short clip, she could be seen stepping out of a convertible wearing a white tank top tucked into blue jeans — just like her ensemble in the iconic Pepsi ad from 1992. For glam, her hair was parted down the side and blown out in a <a href=#>voluminous ‘do</a>. She donned smokey eyeshadow, filled-in eyebrows and a sharp contour.</p><p>Crawford seductively sipped on a cocktail, which was made with husband <a href=#><strong>Rande Gerber</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>’s tequila brand, Casamigos. Two bartenders watched her drink in awe as Crawford threw her head backwards and enjoyed the beverage. Suddenly, That Chick Angel — whose real name is Angel Laketa Moore — jumped into the frame wearing a sparkly green top and shoved Crawford to the side. The music then transitions to her viral song, which features <strong>Saucy Santana</strong>.</p><p>The reference to <a href=#>Crawford’s Super Bowl ad</a> brought on <a href=#>major nostalgia</a>. In the commercial, she pulled up to a gas station and stepped out of a luxurious car, also wearing a skintight white bodysuit and blue denim shorts. Two young boys watched Crawford in disbelief as she shook around her teased mane and chugged a can of Pepsi. The boys then looked at each other with their jaws dropped and said, “Is that a great new Pepsi can, or what?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Cindy-Crawford-Recreates-Her-Iconic-Pepsi-Ad-inline.png><p>In May 2021, Crawford broke down the Pepsi look in a<a href=#> YouTube</a> video for Vogue. She shared that after trying on multiple looks for the ad, the studio asked her if they could “cut off [her] jeans” and make them into shorts. “I said yes, because I take one for the team,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When people dress as me for Halloween, they dress in this outfit,” she said. “This just became iconic because of everything … the outfit, the hair … I also got out of a really cool Lamborghini.”</p><p>Crawford went on to gush over her favorite part of shooting the ad, sharing, “Even though it was <a href=#>super sexy</a> in an all-American way, it was cute too, because there were two little boys that were watching me.”</p><p>She added: “I honestly don’t think the commercial would have been nearly as impactful if it didn’t have that little innocence and sense of humor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i2r7DYZpqrmaebvLOwjKucnKqVlsGmv4yimqimmZh6sbHPrKBmmZRitq95zqecZqWRp7SivsitmGalpai2pHnVopuep18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cinco-de-mayo-recipes.html><span>←</span><span>Cinco de Mayo recipes</span></a>
