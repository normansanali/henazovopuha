She caught the attention of the brewing company and was hired as their spokesmodel. Anderson was soon invited to audition for Playboy and appeared as the cover girl for the magazine’s October 1989 issue. She went on to pose for the magazine for 22 years — more than any other model in the publication’s history.</p><p>Anderson told Us Weekly in 2018 that modeling for Playboy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was therapeutic for her </a>after she suffered sexual abuse as a child.</p><p>“I was painfully shy as a child. As a young girl, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Playboy empowered me</a>. It really saved my life,” she said at the time. “I felt very trapped inside and needed to free myself. It was a breakthrough for me, and there I met artists and activists and gentlemen. It has been a fun and wild life.”</p><p>Anderson landed her first major acting gig in 1991 on the ABC sitcom Home Improvement in a reoccurring role as Tim Taylor’s (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tim Allen</strong></a>) first assistant, Lisa. She left the show after two seasons when she won the role of C.J. Parker on Baywatch&nbsp;one year later. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson starred on the show</a> for five seasons from 1992 until 1997 as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the longest-running cast members.</a></p><p>The actress didn’t have to worry about whether she would get the part because the producers were clamoring to get her on the show.</p><p>“I was asked to audition for Baywatch numerous times since I appeared in Playboy,” she recalled in an interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson Foundation</a> in 2018. “But&nbsp;I didn’t like to drive in L.A. I’d never been on an audition. So I never went. Until one day I tagged along with a friend.&nbsp;We were both hired on the spot.&nbsp;They said I was famous before I walked in the door. Famous for not showing up.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later, Anderson’s tumultuous personal life took the spotlight as she became known for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her high-profile relationships</a> including with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kid Rock</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rick Salomon</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tommy Lee</strong></a>, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whom she shares</a> sons <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Brandon</strong></a> and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Dylan.</strong></a></p><p>Scroll down to see photos of Anderson through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvaK5xKWYZpmembKzv86nZK2goqTCqLSMrZ%2BeZamarrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miah-madden-girlfriend-2021-aubri-ibrag-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>Miah Madden Girlfriend 2021 - Is The Dive Club Actress In A Relationship?</span></a>
