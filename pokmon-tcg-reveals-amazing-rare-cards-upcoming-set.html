Well, somewhat humorously, the name is something of a misnomer. While there’s every chance the rules will change when Legendary Heartbeat makes its way West, each individual booster pack of the Japanese version will come with one Amazing Rare card inserted, meaning collecting ’em all should prove to be a relatively painless affair, especially as the total number of cards in the set numbers just 76.</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>In terms of competitive viability, there appears to be no restriction on their use in such environments, though you can decide for yourselves if they’re worth taking a deck slot via the text translations below (H/T, PokéBeach):</p><p><strong>Jirachi</strong>&nbsp;– Metal – HP70<br>Basic Pokemon</p><p>Ability: Dream Oracle<br>Once during your turn, if this Pokemon is your Active Pokemon, you may look at the top 2 cards of your deck.
