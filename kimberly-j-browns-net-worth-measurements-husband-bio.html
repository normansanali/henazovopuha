Brown?</span></h2><p>Kimberly Jean Brown is a famous American stage and voice actress, as well as a model and author. After she became a model of the noted Ford Agency, she achieved her initial breakthrough in multiple Broadway shows at an early age. She won a Daytime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Marah Lewis in the soap opera “Guiding Light” broadcast in 1993. Kimberly really entered the limelight starring as Marnie Piper in the first three editions of Disney film “Halloweentown” in 1998.</p><h2><span id=Kimberly_J_Brown_Bio-_Age_Childhood_and_Education>Kimberly J. Brown Bio- Age, Childhood, and Education</span></h2><p>Born Kimberly Jean Brown on the 16th November 1984, in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, she is 36 years old at present, and her zodiac sign is Scorpio.</p><p>She hasn’t revealed the name of her father yet, while her mother’s name is Latina Brown; Kimberly has three brothers she grew up with, Roman, Dylan, and Richard. Her artistic talent was uncovered by her parents at a very early age, while she was imitating various characters at home together with her brothers. Subsequently, her mother enrolled her in acting classes. Little is known regarding her educational background, except that after high school, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business.</p><h2><span id=Career_Beginnings_and_Immediate_Success>Career Beginnings and Immediate Success</span></h2><p>For Kimberly, the doors of the world of acting were opened at the early age of five, as a child model in various television commercials.</p><p>The established international agency Ford Models gave her an amazing chance to be part of numerous projects that made her career improve very quickly. She appeared as Amanda Delaney in the live-action TV series “The Baby-Sitters Club” in March 1990, and was just seven years old when she made her first appearance in a Broadway show. At the age of nine, she became the youngest actress to feature in three noted musical shows – “Les Miserables”, “Four Baboons Adoring the Sun”, and “Showboat”. After she took an opportunity to portray the role of Marah Lewis, one of the main characters of the famous soap opera “Guiding Light”, featured in 1993, Kimberly received a nomination at the Daytime Emmy Awards in 1996, which contributed to her popularity.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/main/thumbs/4782_Kimberly-J-Brown.jpg></p><p>As a voice artist, at the age of 13 in 1997, she had her first role for “Vampire Princess Miyu”, the Japanese horror manga series. She continued voicing numerous characters in television commercials, before she featured in the computer-animated Pixar film “Bugs Life” in 1998. The same year came one of the most significant roles of her career, as Kimberly portrayed Marnie Piper in the prominent Disney Channel Original Movie “Halloweentown”. In the movie, she played a young witch who wished to enter the world of magic with the help of Agatha, the character of her grandmother, portrayed by Debbie Reynolds. The movie garnered considerable attention, and positive critiques, which inspired Disney production to release two sequels.</p><h2><span id=Later_Career>Later Career</span></h2><p>With high hopes for success, Kimberly’s role was replaced by Sara Paxton in the fourth and final edition of the movie named “Return to Halloweentown”, premiered in October 2006, but this replacement of roles created big disappointment in the audience as well as in Kimberly, who didn’t hide her feelings expressed openly on social media. Expressing her comic side, Kimberly landed the role as Ava Walker in the comedy-drama film “Tumbleweeds” in 1999, alongside Janet McTeer. The creation of a magical on-screen duo performance resulted in winning the hearts of the entire audience, winning the Independent Spirit Award the next year, and Kimberly also won the Golden Apple Award as the young female discovery in 1999.</p><p>In addition, she portrayed the main role in another Disney movie “Quints” in 2000, as a fourteen-year-old child dealing with her siblings and the attention of her parents.</p><h2><span id=Continual_Success_and_Recent_Projects>Continual Success and Recent Projects</span></h2><p>Years that followed brought her many more notable performances. In 2003, Kimberly landed the role of Annie Wheaton in the distinguished Stephen King’s television miniseries “Rose Red” that aired on ABC. The same year she was cast to play Sarah Sanderson in the movie “Bringing Down the House”, then had an outrageous chance to co-star with icons such as John Travolta and Uma Thurman in the crime-comedy movie “Be Cool” released in 2005.</p><p>As her popularity increased over the years, she won a role in the independent German film “Friendship” in 2010, then later returned to act in TV series such as “Low Winter Sun”, in which she landed a recurring role. Five years later, Kimberly returned to the screen, first with a minor role in the TV mini-series “Mondays”, and then as Angela in the television movie “Crossword Mysteries: Proposing Murder”. She is now working on the thriller film “Abudcted?”, which is currently in pre-production.</p><h2><span id=An_Accomplished_Author>An Accomplished Author</span></h2><p>Besides her acting career, Kimberly is gifted with excellent writing skills, known for having written a Halloween-themed children’s book called “Poppins Pumpkin Patch Parade” with Diane Yslas, published in 201.</p><p>Her creative energy reached the online world as well, as she runs the Etsy shop “Craftily Creative” on which she sells Halloween-themed products.</p><h2><span id=Kimberly_J_Brown_Net_Worth_Height_Weight_and_Appearance>Kimberly J.
