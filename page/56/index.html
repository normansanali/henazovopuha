Selena Gomez’s little sister, Gracie Teefey, is seemingly sharing her thoughts on Gomez’s love life in the music video for her new song, “Single Soon.”
“I love you, sissy. Never worry about boyfriends — at all,” says a young voice at the beginning of Gomez’s video, which dropped on Friday, August 25.
While fans were quick to assume the message comes from 9-year-old Gracie, the 31-year-old Only Murders in the Building star hasn’t confirmed whether her sister — who is the daughter of Gomez’s mom, Mandy Teefey, and stepdad Brian Teefey&nbsp; — is featured on the track.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Explore Robert Cameron's Biography, Wife, Children, &amp;amp; Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 3, 2024</time>

USB 2.0 flash drive performance in a USB 3.0 port
Finally, we tested whether USB 2.0 flash drives benefit from 'up-plugging' into a USB 3.0 port. I expected improved performance compared to use in a USB 2.0 port, and suspected the improvement would be noticeable but not dramatic.

This is likely not even a noticeable difference.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Happened Between Liam Hemsworth And Jennifer Lawrence?</h2><time>Sep 3, 2024</time>

Intellectually speaking, everyone knows that actors are paid to pretend like they are people they are not and that they are feeling emotions that a writer decided their characters should have. However, that doesn’t mean that it can’t be easy to buy into an actor’s performance so much that you think there is some reality to the character they are playing.
