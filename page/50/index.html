However, he has softened Cartman’s voice over the years. He found after a couple of seasons that doing the voice made his throat hurt, so he slowly fazed out the harshness of it. Cartman’s voice also changed after the season 3 episode “The Red Badge of Gayness,” which revolved around a Civil War re-enactment.
Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally be the one to reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with “You know, I’ve learned something today”.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Brad Dourif - Age, Bio, Birthday, Family, Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 5, 2024</time>
