Often portraying tough and rugged men with hearts of gold, Stallone’s presence in movies dates back to the early 70s and has continued to this day with entries into The Expendables franchise. Now, the actor is taking his talents to the small screen with the debut of Tulsa King on <a href=#>Paramount+</a>, and the trailer for the new series showcases the gangster side to Stallone’s famous persona.</p><p>The trailer for <a href=#>Tulsa King</a> debuted on October 16 on Paramount+’s official YouTube channel, with over 728,000 views to date as the new Sylvester Stallone television series is set to debut on the subscription streaming platform on November 13. Costarring an ensemble group of actors like I’m Sorry alum Andrea Savage, Max Casella of The Sopranos fame, Domenick Lombardozzi, Marvel Cinematic Universe actor Martin Starr, Desperate Housewives’ <a href=#>Dana Delany</a>, Annabella Sciorra, and Friday Night Lights star Garrett Hedlund; Tulsa King is created by Yellowstone scribe Taylor Sheridan. Concerning a mafia captain named Dwight “The General” Manfredi (Stallone), Tulsa King will center around the native New Yorker Manfredi’s release from prison and subsequent new life in Tulsa, Oklahoma as he attempts to set up a criminal organization in the Sooner State.</p><p>According to <a href=#>IndieWire</a>, Tulsa King’s Manfredi is actually forced to relocate to Tulsa due to the fact that there isn’t a known criminal enterprise in the second largest city in Oklahoma. Gambling and racketeering operations will be at the heart of Manfredi’s presence in Tulsa, even though his outsider perspective may not be a welcome addition to the city. Sylvester Stallone’s movie star name and talent will hopefully make the new series a hit for the streamer as the actor moves away from movies at the age of 76.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/sylvester-stallone-tulsa-king-900x509.jpg><p>Tulsa King will be a brand new adventure for Sylvester Stallone, as he sheds his Rocky Balboa image and tries his hand at entertaining streaming television audiences. The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire alum Terence Winter is set to be the showrunner on Tulsa King, with Stallone, Sheridan, and Braden Aftergood executive producing the new series.</p><p>At the same time, Sylvester Stallone is looking to start other television ventures. Last week news surfaced that the Demolition Man star was developing an as of yet untitled adventure reality series with <a href=#>Bear Grylls</a>.</p><p>However, just because Sylvester Stallone is starring in a new show doesn’t mean audiences will forget about his movie career. The Italian Stallion will not appear in Creed III alongside Michael B. Jordan but will continue with his Rocky franchise by producing the movie, due to be released in 2023. Also in 2023, Stallone will reprise his role as Stakar Ogord in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, as well as leading The Expendables 4 as Barney Ross, joined by fellow cast members Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Megan Fox, 50 Cent, and Andy García.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irqaHDpr%2FTnqlmq6SWua27zZ5kra2cqK5ut8yipaBlpKeuqrjEq2WhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1365959-rhea-ripley-charlotte-flair-and-i-stole-the-show-at-wrestlemania-39.html><span>←</span><span>Rhea Ripley: Charlotte Flair And I Stole The Show At WrestleMania 39</span></a>
