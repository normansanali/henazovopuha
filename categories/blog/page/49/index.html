<a href=../../../../top-gun-actor-sues-paramount-over-image-in-top-gun-maverick.html></a>
Top Gun actor Barry Tubb is suing Paramount for using his image in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick.
Tubb, 61, portrayed Wolfman in the original 1986 hit alongside Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer, though he did not appear in Top Gun: Maverick.
