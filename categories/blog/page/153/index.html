Congratulations to Pokémon Horizons for reaching its 50th episode! It’s a special milestone, and as such is celebrated with probably one of the best battle episodes the show has offered to date. I’m amazed that Horizons' animators always manage to outdo themselves whenever it comes to creating amazing episodes. It feels like their highs are always getting one-upped, and this week's episode is no exception. Episode 45 was great, but Episode 50 really takes the cake.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why the Academy Awards Are Called Oscars</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>
