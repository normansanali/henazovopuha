This was a rather anticipated battle given the connection these two have as streamers and friends. It was intense too! Dot is definitely the best battler of the three kids and she put up an amazing fight. The way she cleverly used her <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FDot%2527s_Quaxly&hash=a6d2f5d05aaa8152338184934152d758" rel="nofollow noopener">Quaxly</a>’s speed and movement to get an advantage despite having a type disadvantage was so cool to see. Iono is no slouch in battle either. She was always a bit of a tricky fight in the games. Dot should just be glad she didn’t bring out her <a href=#>Mismagius</a> for this fight though! The way Iono fought was as clever as Dot in a way. She tricks Dot into believing she’d use <a href=#>Spark</a>, but actually uses <a href=#>Discharge</a>. The way she makes <a href=#>Bellibolt</a> use <a href=#>Slack Off</a> was also a key factor in her win, as Bellibolt was able to heal while Quaxly couldn’t. To be honest, I thought Quaxly was going to evolve in this episode, but he learned <a href=#>Liquidation</a> instead. I think that’s a fair trade off. While Dot did lose, I think it was handled well, as losing or winning doesn’t matter in this course as long as the Gym Leader acknowledges your effort. This loss is also development for Dot as she learns to let loose and have fun as she’s always been a bit serious when it came to battling, which Quaxly teaches her in this episode. My favorite part of the episode was her terastalizing when the power was out.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/attachments/screenshot-2024-05-18-at-1-07-06-pm-png.188742/ data-url data-zoom-target=1 alt="Liko, Roy, and Clavell" title="Liko, Roy, and Clavell" width=2880 height=1602 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FClavell%23In_the_anime&hash=3bc56aa5238ca432760a19780e1561bb" rel="nofollow noopener">Clavell</a> shows up in <a href=#>Levincia City</a> during this episode as sort of an homage to the Gym Challenge in the games, which he is a part of. Instead of playing Where’s Waldo with the principal, he shows up with a running gag of giving out extremely long and time-consuming lectures. When Roy tells Clavell that Dot’s battle was in process, he, Liko and Clavell start running. Clavell’s running pose is the exact same from the game, and it’s hilarious how much they put so much detail into this. I love that each of the kids fall victim to his lectures.<p>The <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FRising_Volt_Tacklers&hash=764a1867804c65e7b7a1c16db93d5b9c" rel="nofollow noopener">Rising Volt Tacklers</a> play support for Dot as <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FMurdock&hash=991a72e38380c9232f8f12cdbf1a9871" rel="nofollow noopener">Murdock</a> goes all out for being her biggest fan. They watch the show in their hotel room as it’s streamed live. Liko and Roy are her biggest supporters too. Just to see Dot being loved by everyone when she’s not confident herself really makes me smile. She’s really coming out of her shell.</p><p>Now that all three of the kids passed their Basics Course, I do wonder what is in store of them later on. For now, they’re taking a bit of a break as they’re going to focus on their reports for <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbulbapedia.bulbagarden.net%2Fwiki%2FJacq%23In_the_anime&hash=025c0ac893fafff3781f09c7f5fc89e8" rel="nofollow noopener">Jacq</a>.
