Howie revealed in "20/20" that he felt embarrassed after making his confession to Howard Stern as he considered he was humiliating himself and his family.</p><p class=Zg>He even thought that it would end his career because people would know that he had mental issues.</p><p class=Zg>Howie Mandel's <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20354432>OCD</a> has been present since he was only a child. One of the situations that he recalled in the interview took place when he was six years.</p><p class=Zg>Even though he knew how to tie his shoes, he'd refuse to do it because the shoelaces were dirty after touching the floor. His classmates and other kids believed, however, that he just didn't know how to do it.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Howie Mandel on April 4, 2014 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=dh>TERRY MANDEL ON HER HUSBAND'S OCD</h3></p><p class=Zg>Consequently, they kept teasing him for walking around with his shoes untied. The people around him were only part of the problem as he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZNnz9SM4g">said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I had like a fight going on inside. Like, 'I got to wash my hands,' or, 'I feel filthy,' or 'I haven't spent enough time in the shower,' or, 'there's something still crawling on me.'"</p><p class=Zg>Terry, Howie Mandel's wife, was also interviewed during the episode and admitted that, initially, they didn't know he had OCD. She noticed, though, that her husband used to take a lot of showers and had "certain rituals."</p><p class=Zg>Raising their three children was also "tough," according to Terry Mandel, because they would crawl on the floor and get dirty for Howie's standards.</p><p class=Zg>His OCD issue is so severe that he even got built a house in his backyard so that he could escape from the germs that might be around his main home.</p><p class=Zg>Howie also confessed that, if any of his children would be sick, he'd put a mask on. If it were Terry who got ill, they'd sleep and eat in separate rooms.</p><p><h3 class=dh>HOWIE MANDEL IS NOT A FAN OF HANDSHAKES</h3></p><p class=Zg>Shortly after his book was released, the "AGT" judge went to the "Ellen DeGeneres Show" to promote it and talk about his lifetime struggle. There, he wished that people would stop shaking hands and start making bows. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTK5_-37r3A">added</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I don't want any more handshaking. I think we should do like Asia. I think we should all bow. I just wanna be bowed to. I don't wanna be touched."</p><p class=Zg>In a video Howie recorded for the Child Mind Institute, he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA_Qp4Qvtl8">sent a message</a> to his younger self regarding his mental health issues, urging him not to be quiet and ask other people for help.</p><p class=Zg>He pointed out that, while not everybody would understand or have an answer for him, he would develop "a lot of coping skills" that would help him do better</p><p class=Zg>The coronavirus pandemic is definitely challenging for people in Howie's situation, which is why he is taking things very seriously.</p><p class=Zg>Earlier this month, Howie Mandel was seen wearing a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/howie-mandel-wears-hazmat-suit-americas-got-talent-taping-coronavirus-outbreak/>hazmat suit</a>, a gas mask, and protective gloves while making his way into the set of "America's Got Talent" in Pasadena, California. He and his wife have been staying home now, thankfully.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcm1nbXqpu9ainGalkaOxpriMqKWcnV2kvaa6xJ1kpaGmnruoec6cm2aZl6l7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hidden-treasures-the-royal-hourglass-in-disney-dreamlight-valley.html><span>←</span><span>How to Find Hidden Treasures with the Royal Hourglass in Disney Dreamlight Valley</span></a>
