First and foremost, the identical twins from France are thirst traps... and they know it. A quick look at their Instagram accounts shows just how comfortable they are with their bodies and how ready they are to show them off. Of course, this means that they've also garnered enough of a fanbase to start their own businesses and, naturally, their own OnlyFans accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the <a href=#>ridiculous amount of money that Bhad Bhabie has made</a> on OnlyFans as well as <a href=#>what controversial star Bella Thorne has done with the medium</a>, it's natural for fans to wonder about what Pauline and Mathilde Tantot are pulling in. But the truth of their net worth is actually far more complicated than it appears.</p><h2 id=pauline-and-mathilde-39-s-net-worth-is-mysterious>Pauline And Mathilde's Net Worth Is Mysterious</h2><p>Nothing about Pauline and Mathilde's bodies is mysterious. Not only have they put them on full display on multiple occasions, but both have been fairly honest about what they've done to enhance their incredible figures.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How One Tweet From Bella Thorne Caused An Huge Internet Controversy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sponsors have flocked to Pauline and Mathilde's Instagram accounts. Due to their massive following that includes men and women, nearly every single one of their posts is sponsored by some clothing or beauty brand. Additionally, Pauline and Mathilde run their very own bikini line (Khassani Swimwear), which definitely benefits from copious photos of them rocking them... or shedding them, more often than not. This was purely an internet business that took off and found a life of its own. Additionally, their OnlyFan accounts are big earners. While following Mathilde's and Pauline's OnlyFan accounts is free, they hook lusty fans with private messages and paid images and videos. This is how they rake in the big bucks and probably why they, as well as people like<a href=#> Bhad Bhabie, started an OnlyFans account </a>to begin with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to all of the brand endorsements, the success of their bikini line, and all of the money they are raking in from OnlyFans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frisky.com states</a> that the two models are worth about $700,000 - $800,000 each while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Legit claims </a>they are closer to $1 or $2 million each. Regardless, their lavish jet-setting lifestyle, as well as their wardrobes, seem to be entirely bought and paid for so everything else they are just banking. And, the two French-Persian twins are almost definitely on their way to making a ton more money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Travis Barker's Parenting Is In Question After Shanna Moakler Launches OnlyFans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-the-tantot-twins-actually-worth-a-lot-more-money>Are The Tantot Twins Actually Worth A lot More Money?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Worth Spot</a> claims that Pauline, and likely Mathilde as well, actually has a far higher net worth than what's being reported on other sites. This is because they are taking her massive OnlyFans following into account. They claim that Pauline Tantot's net worth is somewhere closer to $19 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Bella Thorne Still On OnlyFans Following The Controversy?</a></span></p><p>They made this estimate based on the 6 million-plus followers on Pauline's account (10 million on Mathilde's) and the average of 200,000 likes per article. This means that any sponsor would likely see some value in Pauline and Mathilde's Instagram accounts and therefore fork over the dough to get them to represent their products. But, given their relatively low level of fame, it's unlikely that they get the sponsorship deals that a <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> would with her massive Instagram following.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-lives-of-the-tantot-twins>The Lives Of The Tantot Twins</h2><p>On top of their mysterious net worths, no one really knows how Pauline and Mathilde first became famous. One day they just seemed to be on everybody's Instagram accounts. What we do know about their actual lives is also somewhat minimal. However, we do know that both women seem to be in long-term relationships with men who also seem equally comfortable showing off their bodies.</p><p>Mathilde has been romantically linked to French model Martin Offenstein. The two first met at a photoshoot in 2016 and haven't been able to separate since. Pauline has had a couple of boyfriends but has been with her current boyfriend, the hunky David Chéri-Zécoté, another model, for a very long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether the twins are swimming in the oceans of a tropical country, perusing the streets of Paris, or laying by their pool in the south of France, they are almost always living their best life and making a ton of money in the process. While we're not precisely certain about the exact figure, there's no doubt that it's growing every day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Tyga Plans To Create His Own Platform After OnlyFans Announced Its Ban For Adult Content</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmq2cnrumecCnm2alkam1qrjDnmStmZ6pvLW%2FjKilpbFdm66vv4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-top-10-longest-womans-matches-in-tennis-history.html><span>←</span><span>The Top 10 Longest Women's Matches in Tennis History</span></a>
