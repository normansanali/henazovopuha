His edgework and agility are top notch.</p><p>He change directions with ease and knows how to maneuver through traffic with and without the puck.</p><p>Cutter also exudes strength and stability on his skates, he makes his way through balanced checks and can drive the net with ease. He also knows how to establish position around the net.</p><p>Knocking him off the puck is very difficult.</p><p>Cutter accurately uses his wrist shot and snapshot to score most of his goals. If he shoots off the wrong foot, finding his balance is not a problem.</p><p>However, he needs to improve on his slap shot and one-timer. He also needs to learn how to adjust and get his shot off with much accuracy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJulqcGmvoygmK6smJ6ys3nAoJxmmqKkwamx0WaaqKScmrSmecinqq2Zl6eurnnSnKaurJmjtG6%2BxKmmq6xf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./click-and-carry-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Click And Carry Net Worth 2024</span></a>
