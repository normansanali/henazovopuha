The situation <a href=#>changed Alec Baldwin's career</a>, and he hasn't been the same since.</p><p>Years prior to Hutchins' passing, Brandon Lee passed away under similar circumstances during The Crow. He seemed to be the perfect fit for the role and years later, fans are still talking about his contributions.</p><p>Fans can get excited as Bill Skarsgård is set to take over. However, it seems like fans aren't entirely sold on the newest version. We're going to take a look at what fans are saying, along with one of Lee's former co-stars, who also doesn't look impressed. We'll also take a look at Lee's final interview ever, and what he had to say about the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/howard-stern-made-eerie-_kill_-comments-to-alec-baldwin-18-years-before-his-fatal-rust-shooting-incident-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Alec Baldwin Made Inappropriate Comments With Howard Stern 18 Years Before His Fatal 'Rust' Shooting Incident">Alec Baldwin Made Inappropriate Comments With Howard Stern 18 Years Before His Fatal 'Rust' Shooting Incident</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Alec Baldwin made eerie comments about the divorce lawyers of his ex-wife, Kim Basinger in a 2003 interview with Howard Stern.</p><h2 id=rochelle-davis-took-issue-to-bill-skarsg-aring-rd-looking-nothing-like-brandon-lee-39-s-version-of-the-crow>Rochelle Davis Took Issue To Bill Skarsgård Looking Nothing Like Brandon Lee's Version Of The Crow</h2><p>As expected, fans had a lot to say looking at Bill Skarsgård's version of The Crow. Right from the start, reactions were very mixed, to put it kindly. Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a former OG cast member slammed the remake attempt</a>.</p><p>Rochelle Davis appeared in the cult classic as Sarah back in 1994. She was less than impressed with the visuals of The Crow, and asked for someone similar to the late Brandon Lee instead. It should be noted that she wasn't knocking the actor for his talent, but just didn't feel like the look matched the film's iconic legacy.</p><p>TMZ writes, "Rochelle's not bashing Bill's talent as an actor ... but she hates his "dingy, dirty, grungy" look and says producers made this version of Eric Draven look like the bad guys he's supposed to be fighting."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/alec-baldwin-worries-that-rust-shooting-charges-will-be-refiled-as-gun-testing-provides-new-evidence.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Alec Baldwin Worries That ‘Rust’ Shooting Charges Will Be Refiled As Gun Testing Provides New Evidence">Alec Baldwin Worries That ‘Rust’ Shooting Charges Will Be Refiled As Gun Testing Provides New Evidence</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The charges were dropped in April, but only so prosecution had more time to collect evidence.</p><p>TMZ also added that Davis felt as though the film needed more diversity as well.</p><p>"Rochelle wishes there was more diversity in the cast ... she says anyone other than a straight white male would be a better fit for replacing Brandon's character -- and she thinks producers should have cast someone who resembles Brandon out of respect."</p><p>It seems like Davis is far from the only one to be let down by The Crowe's new look.</p><h2 id=fans-had-mixed-reactions-to-bill-skarsg-aring-rd-39-s-new-look-for-the-crowe>Fans Had Mixed Reactions To Bill Skarsgård's New Look For The Crowe</h2><p>Opinions were very mixed, with some comparing The Crowe to The Joker. However, there was a minority of fans defending the decision.</p><p>One fan writes, "People need to remember the original was representing that era of music, fashion and vibes. From the pics I dig what I am seeing because it’s doing its own thing and not looking for the next 'Brandon Lee' All I want is the music to be on point.

He passed away a week and a half later. During his interview with EW, it seemed like the actor was fully committed to his role.</p><p>He tells the publication, "When I first met with Alex Proyas, the director, one of the things that he talked about was wanting to see the film through Eric Draven’s eyes.

The character comes back from the dead, and, at first he doesn’t know where he is, how he got there…. How does that tie in with the physicality? I just didn’t think he should be too healthy-looking, so I lost some weight for the role. I’ve been colder on this film than I’ve been in years; I can never remember deliberately going outside when it was about 5 degrees, in the rain, with no shoes on."</p><p>"I think it adds to the character’s experience-I mean, he’s torn up emotionally, physically, and psychically, and the fact that there have been some stringent physical demands placed on me (has) only been helpful in creating that environment."</p><p>The actor was only 28 years old at the time of his passing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScYsCsrdGsnquco2K7psOMpaaoo12bvLN506GcZpuipMRusMidZKenpGLAqsCMsJylpF2strW0jJupmqaUpLtuuMSeqmaen6e6pr6MnKZmq6SWv26tzZ1kn5meqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-adams-daughter-aviana-celebrates-birthday-in-rare-photo.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Adams' Daughter Aviana Celebrates Birthday In Rare Photo</span></a>
