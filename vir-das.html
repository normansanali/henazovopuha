His zodiac sign is Gemini.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Childhood-picture-of-Vir-Das-in-his-mothers-lap-with-his-family-in-1979-in-India.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-84328 class=wp-caption-text>Childhood picture of Vir Das (in his mother’s lap) with his family in 1979 in India</p><p>In 1981, when Vir was one-year-old, his parents moved to Lagos in Nigeria, Africa, where he spent his early childhood. He grew up studying in different boarding schools in India as the schools in Nigeria weren’t good. At the age of nine, he attended The Lawrence School, Sanawar (near Shimla, Himachal Pradesh). Later, he enrolled in Delhi Public School. Since his school days at Sanawar, he actively participated in debates, drama, and athletics, but he was terrible at academics. In an interview, he revealed that he was a rebellious child during his school days. He said,</p><p>This was hard on me, since I was individualistic. I wouldn’t shut up. I was the kid being beaten up but talking through the beating.”</p><p>He discovered his oratory skills at the age of 12 when during a debate interjection round he took the mic and cracked a joke. During his holidays, he used to visit Lagos, where his parents lived in a well-guarded compound consisting of seven houses. Then, Nigeria was home to several Indian expatriates. Due to the disturbed law and order situation in Africa, Indians were recommended to stay indoors, therefore, Vir Das spent his time watching movies from the video library. While recalling his childhood memories of Nigeria, in an interview, he said,</p><p>There were many Indians there with a rich Indian cultural association. But the law and order was bad, so you had to stay indoors with a lot of armed guards at the gate and a lot of drivers…That meant that you couldn’t ride a bike outside, so it was a bit of a closed living. It meant that you don’t drive fancy cars or wear jewels in Africa as you could be robbed.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-picture-of-Vir-Das-along-with-his-sister-Trisha-in-their-family-home-in-Nigeria-in-1989.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-84329 class=wp-caption-text>A picture of Vir Das, along with his sister, Trisha, in their family home in Nigeria in 1989</p><p>When Vir Das was 16, his parents moved back to India after witnessing the deteriorating political and financial situation of Africa. While talking about his parents return to India in an interview, he said,</p><p>When we first went there in 1981, a naira was a dollar-and-a- half, but by the time we left Nigeria, a dollar was probably equal to 120 nairas. That was the journey where it just got worse and worse. Years later, my parents finally moved back to Delhi when there was an emergency in Nigeria and president No. 5 got assassinated and everybody decided, okay it’s time to leave.”</p><p>Growing up he used to watch American collegiate films like Dead Man On Campus (1998) and National Lampoon’s Van Wilder (2002), which intrigued him to pursue his further studies in America. He enrolled himself in Sri Venkateswara College in New Delhi through sports quota, as he was a basketball player. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_2><a href=#>[2]</a></span> Halfway through Sri Venkateswara College, he went to Illinois, to pursue his graduation. He did a double major in economics and theatre from Knox College. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_3><a href=#>[3]</a></span> Then, Knox had a yearly fee of $26,000. Vir Das sponsored his fees worth $20,000 through scholarships and convinced his father to sponsor the rest of the fees by agreeing to his condition to opt for a double major. In the first year of his college, he started playing the guitar, and sometimes, he even earned money via playing the guitar on the streets.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-picture-of-Vir-Das-playing-the-guitar-in-his-college-days.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-84366 class=wp-caption-text>A picture of Vir Das playing the guitar in his college days</p><p>At Knox, he scored poor grades and felt exhausted due to the tough acting programme by the fourth year. He wanted to make a career in a field that was free-flowing, hence, he developed an interest in standup comedy. Also, since childhood, he was intrigued by the work of the American comedian Bill Cosby. For his thesis at Knox, he wrote a 60-minute show called ‘Brown men can’t hump,’ which offended the acting and the drama faculty. After completing his graduation in 2002, he studied acting at the Stanislavsky School at Harvard University. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_4><a href=#>[4]</a></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span>Physical Appearance<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span><strong> Height (approx.): </strong>5′ 8½”</p><p><strong>Hair Colour: </strong>Black</p><p><strong>Eye Colour: </strong>Black</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Comedian-Vir-Das.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family></span>Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Vir Das’s father, Ranu Das, worked as a manager for a poultry farm in Uttar Pradesh.

While talking about his paternal and maternal family in an interview, he said,</p><p>Everyone on my father’s side is in government service. Most of my mother’s relatives worked for the government-run railways. Lagos offered my parents an adventure abroad.

After coming back to India, in 1995, she ventured into filmmaking with her daughter, Trisha Das, who collaborated with Madhur for their documentary films as a director. In 2005, their documentary film ‘Fiddlers on the Thatch,’ about the children of Kalimpong, won a National Film Award in three categories. When Trisha got married and moved to Singapore, Madhur started working for the World Wildlife Fund as a director, and then, she became a TV newsreader. Later, Madhur started working at United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), India. Trisha is four years older than Vir Das. She has directed and written over 40 films, and her work has been broadcast and screened at various platforms, including the Discovery Channel, the Star Network, the Doordarshan channels, and several international film festivals.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Vir-Das-with-his-sister.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-84381 class=wp-caption-text>Vir Das with his sister, Trisha</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wife_Children></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Wife_Children></span><strong>Wife & Children</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In October 2014, he got married to his longtime girlfriend Shivani Mathur, who is the owner of an event management company in Sri Lanka.

In 2014, in an interview, when Vir Das was asked who was the person he was most attached to in his life, he said,</p><p>Shivani. She is my reality. She is the one person who will tell me if my joke sucks, though, of course, she proudly finds me hilarious…She is fiercely intelligent and loyal and one of those people who can make me laugh.”</p><p>In an interview, Vir revealed that he had had thirteen relationships before meeting Shivani. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_6><a href=#>[6]</a></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He joined a bank in Chicago soon after his graduation from Knox, but later, he dropped the finance job to pursue theatre. Thereafter, he pursued various odd jobs like a security guard, building painter, dishwasher, and banquet bartender in Chicago, meanwhile, trying his hand at acting and stand-up comedy. While recalling the days when he was struggling at open mics, in an interview, he said,</p><p>I was booed off, 11 weeks in a row,’ he smiles. ‘I was saying, “Hey, you know what’s funny about cockroaches?” and I got slaughtered. In week 12, I had a meltdown: “You Americans are just stupid, ignorant hicks! You have no idea how important Indians are. We drive your taxis, we sell your newspapers, we sell you condoms and food, our doctors check your wives and children! Without Indians you’d be starving, stranded, sexually sterile and stupid!” And I got my first laugh.”</p><p>In 2003, he secured himself an assignment and he came back to India to perform a show for The Times of India at the Habitat Centre in New Delhi.
