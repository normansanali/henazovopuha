He was surrounded by his family at the time of his passing. On April 5, 1948, he was born in Dover, New Hampshire to parents named Anthony Nicholas George and Margaret Jones.</p><p>He spent some time in Florida before finally relocating to Dover, where he has been living with the woman he has loved for the past quarter of a century, Ann Marie. Nicholas, a former member of the United States Army, spent a significant portion of his career in the construction industry before retiring. Nicholas was a self-proclaimed hippie who enjoyed spending time at the beach and tending to his plants. He also enjoyed spending time in the wilderness.</p><p>Even when he wasn’t watching Westerns on television, you could always find him smiling and doing the peace sign to everyone he encountered. He had an incredible smile every time. The most important thing in Nicholas’s life was his commitment to his family. In addition to having a strong bond with his siblings, he cherished the time he got to spend with all of his grandchildren.</p><p>Anthony Nicholas George and Margaret (Jones) George, Nicholas’s parents, passed away before he was born. He is survived by his devoted wife Ann Marie Byron, his sisters Anne Marie (Gary) Nyberg and Nancy (Larry) Smith, his two brothers Dan (Laurel) George and Steve George, his step-children Bonnie “Boonita” Dextraze, Kimberly Burns, Timothy (Emily) Staples, and Brian (Kristina) Staples, and his many wonderful grandchildren, Dustin Dextraze Jr., Devin Dextraze, Dyllin Dextraze, Brian Staples Jr., Benjamin Staples, Aiden Staples, and Reiley Staples.
