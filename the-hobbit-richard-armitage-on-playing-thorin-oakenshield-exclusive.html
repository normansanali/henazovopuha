Determined to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from Smaug, and secure the coveted Arkenstone, Thorin's redemptive story of greed made him one of the most interesting characters in the trilogy.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehfZ4XYw1mi data-wc=27>Reflecting on The Hobbit's enduring legacy and the profound effect that the franchise had on him, Richard, 52, spoke exclusively to<strong>&nbsp;HELLO!</strong> about his time on set.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/514b1002cfe1-rirchard-armitage-thorin-oakenshield-in-the-mountain.jpg><p id=euvnhHShmKd data-wc=41>On why the role of Thorin was so special to him, Richard explained: "It had an impact on me because I think The Hobbit was one of the first books I ever read where I really allowed my imagination to engage.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg7KUQz25qS data-wc=38>"I was completely absorbed by Tolkien. Then I found Lord of the Rings and I think it was where my early feelers were going towards being an actor, but I didn't realise it at the time," he continued.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eOCADzjcttC data-wc=42>"So, when I came to playing Thorin Oakenshield as a 40-year-old, I was retracing my steps right back to being an eight-year-old in school and finding that book for the first time. So, it was just such a massive thing for me."</p><p id=ecjLZyP7VT7 data-wc=17>As for his time on set, Richard revealed a particularly poignant memory from day one of production.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4269dfa8b84a-thorin-oakenshield-wearing-crown.jpg><p id=e9XKS_gOI-0 data-wc=49>"One of the fondest memories I had was on the very first day of shooting when Peter Jackson blessed his new sound stage with a Māori Haka. I had to speak Māori to the crew because they saw my character as the King of the Dwarves," he tells <strong>HELLO!.</strong></p><p id=ex3nIt9fx1L data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Michelle Keegan and Richard Armitage’s new Netflix Harlan Coben show looks seriously good – details</a></p><p id=eaGla30H3x data-wc=17><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Richard Armitage is set to star in new ITV thriller - and it sounds seriously good</a></p><p id=ehQaI1moMPt data-wc=35>"And so they asked me to make this speech in Māori and the door was lifted and the sun was rising across the floor and it was incredibly moving. It was a really special moment."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d17e943c3c92-the-hobbit-scene.jpg><p id=exWiREikvbY data-wc=35>After wrapping the trilogy with The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&nbsp;(2014), Richard was able to take home a number of his most treasured possessions from the set, which he continues to cherish.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6bFmrpW0h_ data-wc=34>"I have the map and the key to the mountain that was used in the film in a frame," he notes. "And I have Thorin's sword and his oaken shield. It's on my bookshelf!"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/5a062ae89cb7-richard-armitage-news-t.jpg><p id=ewnj_lVz-ty data-wc=34>After the success of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, Tolkeinites have since entered the <a class=hm-link href=#>Rings of Power</a> era, following the release of Amazon Prime's high fantasy series in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZH1haAWHLP data-wc=66>With the show renewed for a second season, naturally, we had to ask if Richard would be interested in a role of some sort. "I mean, I would love to, but I think it's very hard to do that. I'd have to be a different character because you couldn't bring Peter Jackson's version of Thorin Oakenshield into somebody else's. But I love the story," he said.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ3JrZ2V8tbTEZp%2BompKewW6%2ByJyfmqqUYq6zucitmKCdXaS7brzLmrCippdiwam70aKlZqeRoLKvv8einKWcXZrFpLjUrKCvnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-cuban-american-sophia-perez-from-temptation-island.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Sophia Perez from Temptation Island?</span></a>
