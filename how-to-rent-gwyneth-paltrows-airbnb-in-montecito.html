Let us explain: Paltrow recently posted to Instagram a video announcing a new initiative with Airbnb where she’s renting out her luxurious guest house in Montecito, California, to one or two guests for a single night in September."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But then, Paltrow has always been far beyond focus-grouping her messaging for the masses. (“Just get an IV when you have a hangover, People Toeing the Poverty Line!”) At least there will be a host of Goop products to reduce worry wrinkles while planning your strategy for “running into Gwyneth” along the garden path.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-the-details data-injectable=false>What are the details?</h2><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Per the video, Paltrow and her husband, Brad Falchuk, are committing to having dinner with her one-night-only guest(s), but that’s all. And not even in their dining room — in their wine room, which to be fair is nicer than your dining room.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Apparently, Paltrow’s guests can even pick the wine that night, though something tells us she’ll have the staff remove any bottle worth more than $500 before allowing the poors to come over.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Her guests presumably will spend the rest of the time trying to sneak pictures of the main house while “hiking.” Or, they might relax in the actor’s massive swimming pool while wondering just what the hell they are doing so wrong that they can’t afford any of this for themselves.</p><p data-characters=548 data-current-count=853 data-injectable=true>As noted in the post, booking doesn’t begin until Aug. 15 at 10 a.m. PST. Also, the stay is only for the night of Sept. 9. Pricing has not yet been revealed, but how much could a night with the Paltrows possibly cost? (Said in the pitch of <a href=#>Lucille Bluth</a>.) It’s also unclear how the winner(s) will be selected. We can only assume there is a ridiculous screening process involved, as well as a 50-page contract that essentially says you can’t put out cigarettes on Paltrow’s couch or call her “Pepper” or whatever.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>All ribbing aside, Paltrow is known among Los Angelenos as being genuinely kind to the common folk — if a bit aloof — so the energy she’s giving in the video isn’t put on. Life just seems to be really this good for her.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>And while we don’t begrudge anyone who’s looking to unwind for doing it at a lovely estate in Southern California, it’s hard not to see Airbnb’s new promotion as a little tone-deaf at a time when income disparities are worse than they’ve ever been and housing prices are through the roof.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Starting to sweat thinking about your life choices? Don’t worry, there’s a pore-refining tonic by Goop for just that kind of existential crisis. You’ll find it next to the soaking tub.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMraZmqpWjwW6z1rKlnqyYYr2iuNOrprCrXZa2s67Nm2Sipl2ivK%2FAxJygradf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-does-bronny-james-make-from-nil.html><span>←</span><span>How much does Bronny James make from NIL?</span></a>
