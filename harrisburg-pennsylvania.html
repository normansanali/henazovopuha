It was also a key area after the Church was restored, and in the first decade of the restored Church of Jesus Christ in the 1830s, a <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>dozen congregations</u></a> were organized in Pennsylvania prior to the Saints’ gathering in Ohio, Missouri and Illinois.</p><p>Many <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0><u>significant events in the beginning stages of the Restoration</u></a> occurred in this eastern state in the early days of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
