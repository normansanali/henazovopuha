This biography contains information about his age, occupation, and other aspects surrounding his life.</p><h3><strong>Meet Michael McDonald, Tennis Star Mackenzie McDonald Father</strong></h3><p>Michael McDonald has been a great father and coach growing up before tennis star Mackenzie McDonald found success. Now, he is his greatest supporter.</p><p>Michael and his wife welcomed Mackenzie on 16 April 1995. On Father’s Day 2019, MacKenzie wished her dad, “<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Happy Fathers Day Dad!! Thank you for all the love, sacrifices, support, and guidance. I love you&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#Bruins</a>.”</span></p><p>MacKenzie’s father is of Scottish and English ancestry.</p><h3><strong>Michael McDonald Wife</strong></h3><p>Michael McDonald, the father of MacKenzie, was previously married to <a href=#>Vivan McDonald</a>. It’s also unknown how and when they first connected. On none of the family member’s social media accounts, there are any posts where the people appear together. Additionally, they haven’t specified when and how long they were married to one another.</p><p><span class=xt0psk2>In January 2023, Vivian McDonald is 57 years old. Her birth occurred in July 1965. She is the owner of <a href=#>Westside Joe’s Bikes</a>.</span></p><p><span class=xt0psk2>On Webster Street, the first Joe’s Bike Shop opened its doors in 1939. In the 1970s, Joe employed Chris (Grae’s brother) to assist him in putting his bikes together. Joe’s wife sold the company to Rick and Judy after he passed away. Joe’s Bike Shop moved to Encinal Ave. near Morton St. in 1980. </span><span class=xt0psk2>The new owners engaged Grae to work on it and decided to give him a chance. It was a dream come true to work at Joe’s. When Grae wasn’t fixing cars, he worked part-time at La Val’s Pizza on Bay Farm Island and trained for triathlons.</span></p><p>In 2015, Vivian & Grae gladly returned Joe’s to its original location as Westside Joe’s Bikes after discovering a shop in one of Alameda’s first commercial structures. Since Grae left the company in 2019, Vivia has been the owner and manager. Since then, the business has proudly served as Alameda’s premier bicycle repair shop, providing high-quality services as well as donating previously owned bicycles to people in South Africa.</p><p>The business <a href=#>provides services</a> such as repair, maintenance, rentals, and more. Here are some of the <a href=#>featured products</a>. She is also an artist and photographer who owns her own studio. Vivian seems to lead a rich and fulfilling life that isn’t solely centered on her son’s tennis career as seen by the fact that the majority of her social media posts are about her artwork.</p><p>You can also connect on <a href=#>Facebook</a> and <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Talking about her education, Vivian attended Encinal High School and Will C. Wood Middle School. At UC Berkley, she studied Conservation & Resource Studies – Public Health, then attended Registered Dental Hygienist at UC San Francisco, School of Dentistry, and studied Masters in Art Education at Universidad Academia de Arte.</p><p>Dana McDonald, the elder daughter of the marriage, was also born. Dana’s birthdate is December 28, 1992. She thus reached her 30th birthday in December 2022. In fact, Dana is married now to her husband Brett Jones.</p><p>Dana and Brett have been wed since May 15, 2015. Dana went to Piedmont High, UCLA, and the Arthur A. Dugoni School of Dentistry before graduating. Dana is the mother of Rome, according to her Instagram. Dana and Mackenzie are the only siblings and are very close to one another. She is accessible on <a href=#>FB</a> and <a href=#>IG</a>.</p><h3><strong>Is Michael McDonald On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Michael McDonald is on Instagram (<a href=#>@macbruin82</a>).</p><h3><strong>Michael McDonald Age</strong></h3><p>Born in November 1960, Michael McDonald is now 62 years old.</p><h3><strong>Michael McDonald Job</strong></h3><p>Michael McDonald is an oral surgeon at <a href=#>McDonald Oral Surgery</a>.
