Her second studio album, “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got” (1990), was a massive success, selling over seven million copies worldwide and featuring the iconic single “Nothing Compares 2 U,” written by Prince, which earned accolades and topped charts.</p><p>Throughout her musical journey, she released ten studio albums and also contributed songs to films, collaborated with other artists, and participated in charity fundraising events. Her 2021 memoir, “Rememberings,” became a bestseller.</p><p>In 1999, she became ordained as a priest by the Latin Tridentine Church, a group not recognized by the mainstream Catholic Church. She was a vocal advocate for issues related to child abuse, human rights, anti-racism, women’s rights, and organized religion. In the year 2017, she reportedly changed her name to Magda Davitt. Additionally, in 2018, she converted to Islam, and upon her conversion, she chose the name Shuhada’ Sadaqat. Despite these changes, she continued to record and perform using her birth name.</p><p>Sinéad O’Connor’s personal life was marked by struggles with her family, and she openly shared allegations of abuse she faced during her childhood. She was a passionate supporter of a united Ireland and a vocal critic of violence, calling for changes within the Sinn Féin party and the country’s political landscape.</p><p>Her religious beliefs were complex, and she had been associated with various religious groups over the years. She was ordained as a priest by the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church in the late 1990s, despite the Roman Catholic Church not recognizing women’s ordination. In August 2018, she asked Pope Francis to excommunicate her.</p><p>She considered herself a Christian and believed in core Christian concepts about the Trinity and Jesus Christ. Shuhada’ Sadaqat believed that God saved everyone, regardless of their desires, and rejected the idea of God judging people. Her Christian faith played a significant role in helping her overcome the effects of her childhood abuse.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sinéad O’Connor</a> was a fearless and outspoken individual, using her platform as a musician to advocate for important social issues and bring attention to injustices. Her talent and influence made a lasting impact on the music industry and beyond.</p><p>At the time of this report, no cause of death has been attributed to her death. She reportedly died on July 26, 2023.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sinead O’Connor Husband: Was Sinead O’Connor Married?</h2><p>Sinead O’Connor has been married and divorced four times, with her personal life experiencing both triumphs and challenges. Her first husband was music producer John Reynolds, with whom she had her first son, Jake, in 1987. The couple later married in 1989 but faced difficulties in their relationship. Following her marriage to John, she had an abortion and wrote the song “My Special Child” about the emotional experience.</p><p>Her second husband was Irish journalist John Waters, with whom she had a daughter, Brigidine Roisin Waters, born in 1996. Their marriage ended with a lengthy custody battle, leading to Brigidine living in Dublin with her father.</p><p>O’Connor’s third husband was British journalist Nick Sommerlad, but their marriage lasted only 11 months.
