Well, not him necessarily, because he’ll be animated. <a href=#>The Bad Guys</a> is the latest animated feature from Dreamworks, and it features Sam Rockwell voicing the leader of the ragtag heist crew, Mr. Wolf. The trailer introduces us to the rest of the heist crew as well.</p><p>In addition to Sam Rockwell, we meet the vault-cracker Mr. Snake (<a href=#>Marc Maron</a>), the hacker Ms. Tarantula (<a href=#>Awkwafina</a>), the muscle Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos), and the master of disguise Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson). Zazie Beetz is also featured as Diane Foxington and Richard Ayoade is Professor Marmalade, the guinea pig in the trailer teaching the bad guys how to be good. Check out Sam Rockwell in the latest trailer for The Bad Guys below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Along with Sam Rockwell and the others, the voice cast for The Bad Guys is rounded out by Alex Borstein and Lilly Singh. Pierre Perifel directs with Etan Cohen, Hilary Winston, and Aaron Blabey credited as writers. Aaron Blabey created the children’s books the movie is based on and also serves as an executive producer.</p><p>The second trailer for The Bad Guys also gives us some more details of the story. In the trailer, Sam Rockwell’s Mr. Wolf and the rest of his crew get caught during one of their heists. Instead of getting locked up, it looks like they’re going to get a chance at redeeming themselves and becoming good guys instead of always being known as the antagonists. While the initial plan looks like it’s just a ruse for them to continue on with their heisting, the good guy stuff seems like it might take with some of the crew and not sit well with the others.</p><p>The Bad Guys will be the first animated feature released by Dreamworks this year. In 2021, they had a <a href=#>relatively quiet year</a>, releasing three movies that didn’t really make much headway at the box office. Spirit Untamed was their worst theatrical release of all time, only bringing in around $17.6 million domestically. The Boss Baby: Family Business didn’t fare much better, only ranking <a href=#>#36 out of 40</a> in their domestic lifetime grosses. The last movie they released in July of last year, Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans was a Netflix film.</p><p>With the pandemic more controlled at this point and more theatres staying open, they’re likely hoping The Bad Guys can get them back on track. In addition to The Bad Guys, Dreamworks also has a Puss in Boots movie set to release in 2022. Hopefully, Sam Rockwell and company can bring Dreamworks their next big hit.</p><p>The Bad Guys is also Dreamwork’s first new property since 2019’s Abominable. All the other movies they’re released since then have been continuations of a franchise. It’s likely Dreamworks is hoping they have the next Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, or How to Train Your Dragon-sized hit on their hands. If you’re interested to see their take on the heist genre, you can catch Sam Rockwell, Awkafina, and the rest in theatres on April 22, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irkaJ6s7vCpK6epJxiwamxjJuYnWWXqsa0esetpKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robyn-metzger-obituary-and-cause-of-death-as-larchwood-iowa-native-member-died-at-41.html><span>←</span><span>Robyn Metzger Obituary and Cause of Death as Larchwood Iowa native member died at 41</span></a>
