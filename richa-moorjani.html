Richa started learning how to dance at the age of five, and now she is a famous dancer who frequently posts her dancing videos on YouTube and Instagram. But Richa was not limited to just dancing, the art of performing led her to the stage, and it was only natural for the actress to make her way in front of the camera.</p><p>Richa Moorjani was born <strong>Richa Shukla</strong> to her Indian parents, who raised her in Bay Area, California. Her parents were also from a performing arts background, and they instilled in Richa the same beliefs, which allowed the actress to fall in love with performing and set the building blocks for her career, later on in her life.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-svLPrlpwW/</p><p>The actress started with a stage performance in her high school; later, she enrolled in theatre school, and after graduating, she moved to Los Angeles in order to star in movies and TV shows. Most of the roles she got were one-off performances and supporting roles, which were not extensive in their scope. Finally, after almost a decade in the industry, Richa is getting her chance to impress in the new Netflix series.</p><h2>Richa Moorjani plays Kamala in the Netflix Series Never Have I Ever</h2><p></p><p>Never Have I Ever is a coming of age story about a teenage Tamil girl, <strong>Devi</strong>, played by <a href=#><strong>Maitreyi Ramakrishnan</strong></a>, living in California who finds it hard to reconcile her teenage needs and desires with the expectations of her family and culture. The show is created by <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> and <strong>Lang Fisher</strong> and consists of a primary south-Asian cast along with a lead who was selected from a pool of over 15,000 aspirants.</p><p>Richa Moorjani plays <strong>Kamala</strong> in the series; she is the cousin of Devi from India who is trying to complete her Ph.D. from Caltech. The three generations of women from South-Asia are represented by the three ladies in the family. Kamal is someone who grew up in India and moved to the US, whereas Devi represents the new generation of TikTok influenced teenage south-Asian girls, and <strong>Poorna Jagannathan</strong>’s character of <strong>Nalini</strong> is a cultural mother who is trying to raise her daughter right.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2020/04/Richa-Moorjani-plays-Kamal-in-the-Netflix-seires-Never-Have-I-Ever..jpg alt="Richa Moorjani plays Kamala in the Netflix series Never Have I Ever." width=450 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Richa Moorjani plays Kamala in the Netflix series Never Have I Ever.</strong><br><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>Richa Moorjani Instagram</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>There is a lot of buzz surrounding the series, most of it is because of Midy Kaling’s involvement, but it is also being lauded for finally showing a teenage female lead character from the Indian subcontinent in the small screen. The cast is being praised by critics for their performance, and the consensus among critics is the show is a good watch.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Never Have I Ever</strong></a> is streaming worldwide on <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong> </a>starting from 27 April 2020, starring Maitreyi Ramakrishnan as Devi, Poorna Jagannathan as Nalini, Richa Moorjani as Kamala, <strong>Sendhil Ramamurthy</strong> as <strong>Mohan</strong>, <strong>Ramona Young</strong> as <strong>Eleanor</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Lee Rodriguez</strong></a> as <strong>Fabiola</strong>, <strong>Darren Barnet</strong> as <strong>Paxton Hall-Yoshida</strong>, and <a href=#><strong>Jaren Lewison</strong></a> as <strong>Ben Gross</strong>.</p><h2>Richa Moorjani Graduated from U.C.
