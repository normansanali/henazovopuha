But "Bull" was also a headache for the network. In 2018, <a href=#>The New York Times</a> reported that CBS agreed to a confidential settlement with <a href=#>"Bull" actor Eliza Dushku</a>, paying her $9.5 million. The settlement was the amount the network determined Dushku would have earned if she was a cast member on "Bull" for four seasons. Dushku claimed that once producers decided her character would be the on-screen love interest of the titular Jason Bull, Weatherly "remarked on her appearance and made a rape joke and a comment about a threesome." The Times reported that after Dushku confronted Weatherly about his behavior, she was fired from the series.</p><p>Weatherly addressed the situation with Dushku in a statement: "When Eliza told me that she wasn't comfortable with my language and attempt at humor, I was mortified to have offended her and immediately apologized. After reflecting on this further, I better understand that what I said was both not funny and not appropriate. I am sorry and regret the pain this caused Eliza." In 2021, <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported Dushku testified before the House Judiciary Committee about her experience being "fired in silence" from "Bull," and urged Congress to pass laws to protect more women against sexual harassment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG9laX53e8eormalmZi1orHLZq6emaSdsrO42KxkqKZdqLK1ecGen5qumaS%2Fbq%2FArqqenF2pv7DBwaWcZp6fp3qkrtJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gigi-hadid-denies-she-was-snorting-cocaine-in-cody-simpsons-snapchat-2015163.html><span>←</span><span>Gigi Hadid Denies She Was Snorting Cocaine in Cody Simpson's Snapchat</span></a>
