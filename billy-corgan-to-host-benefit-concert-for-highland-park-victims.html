In the video, recorded with Mendel outside of Madame Zuzu’s, Corgan said a special charity concert to raise donations for the July 4th Victims Response Fund will occur on July 27.</p><p>“About a week ago on July 4th, we had the horrible tragedy here in Highland Park that took so many lives, and has injured so many people and has really affected so many of us as a community,” Corgan said. “So what we wanted to do is on the evening of July 27th, is we’re going to have a very special charity concert.”</p><p>The July 4 shooting took place during the Chicago, Ill. suburb’s annual Independence Day parade. Seven people were killed, with over 40 people receiving injuries during the event.</p><p>According to Corgan’s video, the concert will be broadcast live on Youtube for free, with viewers being able to make charitable donations through the platform. In addition, Corgan said that “special guests” would appear along at the concert, including current Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin and other members of the band, and that more details would be announced in the coming days.</p><p>“We really appreciate you guys joining us in this moment and helping us support those with unmet needs right now,” Mendel said in the video. The victims and families really need help.”</p><p>Watch Corrigan and Mendel’s full video below.</p><p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tompmhubp5wqipoJmeYsGweceoqq1lkpq7prLIrWScp56YsrPAjJ%2Bmq2WYnrSpuMCnm2aokae4bsLInKuipaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eugenio-derbez-interview-new-film-radical-1235612573.html><span>←</span><span>Actor Strips Down for His New Film Radical The Hollywood Reporter</span></a>
