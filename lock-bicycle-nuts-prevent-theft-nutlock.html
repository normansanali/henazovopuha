However, your front or rear wheel, if left unlocked, can be pulled off by a thief with nothing more than a wrench or a pair of pliers. Even worse, if you lock your wheel instead of your frame, when a thief can remove your wheel and take off with the rest of the bike. Nutlock solves this by machining unique fasteners that can only be removed with a special wrench. Best of all, the fasteners cost just $39 for two wheels, far cheaper than other wheel locks that exist. If you just want to fasten one set of wheels, you can get the Nutlock for $25.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>This 60-second patching system lets you fix a flat without taking off the tire off the bike.</a></p><p>Nutlock works by taking a steel fastener and creating a special rounded surface that rejects pliers and wrenches, but accepts your Nutlock key, a special tool that can grab onto the fastener and loosen your wheels. It’s also small enough to fit on your keychain and includes a bottle opener – because why not. This ensures you can keep your Nutlock key handy with your U-Lock or other bicycle locks.</p><p>The key you get with your Nutlock is not entirely unique, but the Nutlock team says there will be many variations and that a thief cannot buy a few Nutlocks and have access to all the variations. The Nutlock key will also have a code on it that, should you lose it, will let you get a replacement key as long as you write down the code somewhere.</p><p>Nutlock is compatible with most bikes on the market and you’ll be able to specify in the Kickstarter whether you have &nbsp;a solid nut or other wheel assemblies, including quick-release. If you have a quick-release, Nutlock can be integrated to still allow easy access to your wheels, but ensure no thieves can steal your wheels either.</p><p>If you’re interested in Nutlock, you can check out its&nbsp;<a href=#>Kickstarter</a>. Unfortunately,&nbsp;you’ll still have to wait until March 2015 to get your hands on a set. Keep your bike safe until then.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLywuIytnJygX6G8pLeMm6CcsZOhsm661K2qZqiimsOmutNmq6Gdlql6r8HTpaaco18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nukaaka-coster-waldau.html><span>←</span><span>Nukaaka Coster-Waldau</span></a>
