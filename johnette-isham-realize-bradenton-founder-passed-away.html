She worked tirelessly to bring people together, promote civic pride, and economic development.</p><p>Johnette celebrated the arts with a great deal of passion. She worked with local artists to install public art in downtown spaces and enthusiastically supported local entrepreneurs, makers, creators, musicians, and business owners. Outside of the office, she was known by her friends and coworkers for her quirky costumes, spontaneous dance parties, and love of pigs in a blanket.</p><p>Although Johnette retired from her role at Realize Bradenton in October of 2022, she continued to support the community through her new, self-proclaimed role as Bradenton’s Biggest Cheerleader.</p><p>We will remember her for her countless big ideas, limitless enthusiasm, and the positive influence she had on our community. She will be missed.</p><p>We understand that many of you want to comfort her family at this time; however, they have asked to please respect their privacy and provide space as they grieve.</p><p><strong>Jim Copening Shared a Post on Facebook writing:</strong></p><p>I just learned about my friend Johnette Isham, who just passed. I found this photo of us at the long table in Bradenton. The only photo I could find with Johnette and myself . I will miss her.

Plans are underway to honor her memory and advance her work. Isham’s courage and pioneer spirit will remain etched in Bradenton’s history and continue motivating future generations.</p><p>Bradenton fondly remembers Johnette Isham – an unwavering force for community progress through the power of arts philanthropy and design.
