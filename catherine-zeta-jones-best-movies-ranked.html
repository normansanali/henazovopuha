Even though the charming star's film debut was in <strong>1001 Nights </strong>(1990), she rose to fame by appearing in the action film <strong>The Mask of Zorro </strong>(1998). These are some of her best movies to date.</p><h2 id=39-red-2-39-2013><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'Red 2' (2013)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/catherine-zeta-jones-in-red-2.jpg><p>In <strong>Red 2</strong>, Frank Moses, a retired CIA agent played by <a href=#>iconic action hero <strong>Bruce Willis</strong></a>, brings together his unlikely team of elite operatives once again to embark on a global mission to locate a missing portable nuclear device.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why 'Red' Is The Most Underrated DC Adaptation</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star plays a Russian secret agent named Miranda Wood in <strong>Dean Parisot</strong>'s second installment to the crime action comedy franchise, which is arguably a much weaker installment than the first one that came out in 2010. Still, even though it had the potential to be a greater film, Red 2 is watchable, providing audiences with entertainment nonetheless.</p><h2 id=39-ocean-39-s-twelve-39-2004><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>'Ocean's Twelve' (2004)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/brad-pitt-and-catherine-zeta-jones-in-ocean-s-twelve.jpg><p>Set three years after pulling off one of the biggest heists ever in Vegas, Danny Ocean's (<strong>George</strong><strong>Clooney</strong>) 11-strong crew now find themselves being tracked down by enraged casino boss Terry Benedict (<strong>Andy</strong><strong>Garcia</strong>), stopping at nothing to get his money back.

While <strong>Ocean's Twelve </strong>does not add much to the original, it is still a harmless movie with well-known faces that will <a href=#>likely still offer viewers a fun time</a> in front of the screen, even if it is hardly <a href=#>the best of the franchise</a>.</p><h2 id=39-no-reservations-39-2007><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>'No Reservations' (2007)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/catherine-zeta-jones-in-no-reservations.jpg><p><strong>Scott Hicks</strong>' fun romantic comedy,<strong> No Reservations</strong>, depicts the challenging bond between the intimidating and intense master chef Kate Armstrong (Zeta-Jones) and brash sous-chef (<strong>Aaron</strong><strong>Eckhart</strong>), who steps into Kate's life when she finds herself forced to become the guardian of her young niece (<strong>Abigail</strong><strong>Breslin</strong>).</p><p>While far from being a groundbreaking romance film, No Reservations still manages to grab audiences' attention, especially those who enjoy <a href=#>the rom-com genre</a>. The star's performance in the film as a short-tempered and perfectionistic chef is believable, and Kate is arguably among her best characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-intolerable-cruelty-39-2003><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Intolerable Cruelty' (2003)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/catherine-zeta-jones-in-intolerable-cruelty.jpg><p>Directed by <a href=#>the beloved <strong>Coen Brothers</strong></a>, <strong>Intolerable Cruelty </strong>is perhaps the most mainstream and conventional of the filmmaker duo's unforgettable films. The romantic comedy <a href=#>features George Clooney</a> and Catherine Zeta-Jones as two characters who match wits and fall in love, despite being on opposite sides of a divorce case in Beverly Hills.</p><p>Audiences can expect a hilarious time in front of the screen in this intriguing battle of the sexes, which is often considered to be one of the most underrated works by the Coen Brothers. Witty and amusing, Intolerable Cruelty is a screwball comedy that will steal some chuckles from viewers.</p><h2 id=39-the-terminal-39-2004><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'The Terminal' (2004)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/catherine-zeta-jones-in-the-terminal.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upon being refused entry to the United States, a man from Eastern European (played by national treasure <strong>Tom Hanks</strong>) is stranded in the terminal of New York's John F.

In this well-known dramedy, a record store owner and compulsive list maker recounts his top five breakups, which include the one in progress.</p><p>With a talented ensemble cast and an engaging premise, High Fidelity shines a light on the power of music, which is often resorted to as a healing tool. It is both funny and witty, with an amazing soundtrack to match. What's more, the actress stars as Charlie Nicholson, one of Rob's exes, in the film.</p><h2 id=39-the-mask-of-zorro-39-1998><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'The Mask of Zorro' (1998)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/catherine-zeta-jones-in-the-mask-of-zorro.jpg><p>Having premiered in the Summer of 1998 and starring <strong>Antonio</strong><strong>Banderas</strong>, <strong>The Mask of Zorro</strong> was both a critical and commercial success.
