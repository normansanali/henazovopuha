Under Stewart's guidance, The Daily Show won 22 Primetime Emmy Awards. He helped shape television and how an entire generation engaged with politics.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-man-of-wit-amp-wisdom-personal-life-amp-highlights>Man Of Wit & Wisdom: Personal Life & Highlights</h2></span><p>NEW YORK - OCTOBER 8: Television host Jon Stewart is seen at Barnes & Noble in Union Square.
