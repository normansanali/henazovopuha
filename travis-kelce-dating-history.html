The other reason? Travis is now being linked to American pop and country music singer <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p>Although Taylor and <a href=#>Matty Healy</a> reportedly dated sometime around May 2023, it appears the "I Can See You" singer has moved on.</p><p>While plenty of Travis's teammates and friends have settled down, Travis hasn’t taken that trip down the aisle yet. Here’s what we know about the <a href=#>NFL</a> player’s romantic past and present — and maybe even his future.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Travis Kelce’s dating history includes breaking up and making up with Kayla Nicole.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Travis doesn’t seem to share too much about his personal life on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. However, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, the pro athlete was previously linked to Kayla Nicole (they go as far back as 2017), although the pair is <a href=#>no longer together</a>.</p><p>The sports star spoke about Kayla in December 2020, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, "She's the best. She's the absolute best." So who is the lucky lady who snagged Travis’s heart over the course of five years? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, she’s a graduate of Pepperdine University who now works as an interviewer of professional athletes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The couple met on social media, with Kayla, who has also worked as a model, revealing, "He had been following me and insta-flirting for a few months.” They frequently hit red carpets together, and she has even developed a close friendship with Brittany, with the two WAGS previously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working out together</a> as recently as January of 2023. More on why that's somewhat scandalous in a moment. First, Travis has a very interesting past when it comes to finding women.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Before pairing off with Kayla, Travis was on a reality dating show.</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Back in 2016, Travis starred on an E! reality show called Chasing Kelce. The NFL star found love on the competition series, choosing Kentucky native <a href=#>Maya Benberry</a> in the end zone. Although he told his soon-to-be girlfriend she seemed somewhat arrogant and said during the finale, “I have been attracted to women like that my entire life, and those relationships didn't work because of that. I don't want that anymore.” Travis ultimately walked away with Maya, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! News</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But after eight months, the reality romance had fizzled, and Travis quickly moved on with Kayla. Now, fans suspect he is moving on again, having reportedly called things off with Kayla in the fall of 2022.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Travis may be dating someone new.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>We don’t know where the athlete stands on the issue of marriage, but per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Republic World</a>, Kayla previously hinted on social media that she is “ready to be a wife.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But going to the chapel doesn't seem to be in the cards for the couple, as rumors began to spread that the Chiefs player had called it quits with Kayla at the end of 2022 — although she seemed to still be attending games in October 2022, per her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> — and started dating Access Hollywood’s <a href=#>Zuri Hall</a>, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barstool Sports</a>.</p><p>Although Travis nor Zuri confirmed or denied reports that they dated, it seems Travis has his eye on someone new.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>After rumors began stirring that he and Taylor were dating, the two were spotted leaving the Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City after the Sept. 24, 2023 game.
