The US Marshals Service New York/New Jersey Fugitive Task Team seized Surf at 1:30 p.m., according to Fox 5 New York. He was transferred to the Essex County Prison in Newark, New Jersey, where he remains incarcerated.</strong></p><p>According to accounts, Surf was arrested at his house, where he resided with an unnamed woman. According to accounts, Surf attempted to flee by the rear door, but the house was already surrounded by authorities.</p><p>When he learned this, he returned to the residence and barricaded himself inside until crisis negotiators arrived, at which time he surrendered.</p><p>On October 14, Tsu will appear in federal court before a judge. Lisa Avers was informed by Qua Bellamy, his manager, that he is in good spirits and prepared to cope with a federal law enforcement problem. Avers stated in a video on her Twitter account.</p><p>He states that he also intends to provide for his dependent family and business associates. Qua claims that Tsu is not yet aware of the gravity of the situation, but is preparing for the worse and hoping for the best.</p><h2>About Tsu Surf</h2><p>He was born Rahjon Cox on <strong>January 15, 1990</strong>. Surf is well-known for his numerous appearances at Smack/URL events and his numerous mixtape releases.</p><p>The NBA player Kevin Durant included the song Want It in one of his singles.
