Much."</span></span></p><p>King, 34, popped the question to the TVD actress, 27, in <a href=#>Florence, Italy in May 2013. </a>"Cheers from the future Mr. & Mrs. Joseph Aaron King!" Accola captioned a picture with the guitarist-songwriter, as she showed off her gorgeous engagement ring.</p><p>Accola's TVD costar<strong> <a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a></strong> quickly chimed in about the proposal.

Because yellow isn't a good color on me."</p><p>The bride-to-be was just as ecstatic.
