He was a highly recruited player from a young age and was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles with the third overall pick in the 2010 MLB draft. Machado is a right-handed batter and thrower.</p><p>In the 2010 MLB draft, Machado was selected third overall by the Baltimore Orioles, making him the second high school player and second position player to be drafted. He signed a $5.25 million contract with the Orioles just before the deadline on August 16, 2010. While his agent, Scott Boras, was negotiating his contract, Machado played for USA Baseball’s 18-and-under national team during the summer of 2010. Machado was introduced to the Orioles in mid-September when they hosted the New York Yankees.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On August 22, 2010, Machado joined the Gulf Coast League Orioles at the Orioles minor league complex. He made his professional debut as the designated hitter for the team on August 27, 2010, where he went 0-for-3 with a strikeout.</p><p>He hit his first professional home run in his second game with the team. Machado then made his debut with the Low-A Aberdeen IronBirds of the New York–Penn League on August 30, 2010, where he went 1-for-3 with a single.</p><p>He played shortstop instead of being the designated hitter, as he did with the Orioles, and was pulled after the fifth inning. Machado began the 2011 season with the Delmarva Shorebirds, where he hit five home runs before May 1 and was named the South Atlantic League player of the week for April 25 – May 1.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After missing several weeks with a knee injury, he returned to play 10 more games and appear in the SAL All-Star Game on June 21, 2011. After the game, he was promoted to the High-A Frederick Keys. He was also named to appear in the 2012 All-Star Futures Game.</p><p>The Orioles promoted Machado to MLB from the Double-A Bowie Baysox on August 9, 2012, against the Kansas City Royals. He started at third base, as the team already had J. J. Hardy at shortstop.</p><p>The following day, against the same opponent, he hit his first and second career home runs, making him the youngest Oriole and 12th youngest player in major league history to have a multi-homer game.</p><p>The two home runs were both off former number-one overall draft choice Luke Hochevar. Machado then hit his third career home run on August 12 off Bruce Chen. In Game 3 of the 2012 ALDS, Machado hit his first career postseason home run. The Orioles lost the division series to the New York Yankees in five games.</p><p>On February 21, 2019, Machado signed a 10-year, $300 million contract with the San Diego Padres, making it the largest free-agent contract in American sports history at the time, until Bryce Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies two weeks later.</p><p>On February 24, 2023, during spring training, Machado became the first player to violate Major League Baseball’s newly instituted pitch clock, being charged with an automatic strike after not being in the batter’s box with eight seconds on the clock.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Manny Machado Children: Does Manny Machado Have Children?</h2><p>W gathered that Manny Machado and his lovely wife have one child.
