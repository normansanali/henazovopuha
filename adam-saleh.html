A woman who wishes to remain nameless said that Saleh had raped her. Saleh made no denials when asked about them.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Disagreement about a Delta flight</h3><p>Saleh claimed he was removed from a December 2016 Delta flight at Heathrow Airport due to his use of the Arabic language.
