<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Camera Performance - The LG X Power Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Camera Quality</h2><p>The camera is another aspect of the LG X Power that differs between the international and North American models. The international model sports a 13MP camera with a f/2.2 aperture and 1.12µm pixels, while the North American model drops down to an 8MP sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. The North American model also gives up 1080p video support and can only record at 720p, which is honestly sad for a smartphone launching in late 2016. The reason for this is simply a limitation of the SoC's image signal processor, and so it's just another situation where the North American model is crippled as a result of its SoC.</p><p>I'm really not a fan of LG selling two different phones under the exact same name just because they look the same, but I can really only work with what I have. I've done two photo comparisons with the LG X Power just to get an idea of what one can expect from the 8MP rear-facing camera on the North American model.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10515/LGPX2_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>I actually haven't reviewed many phones in the $100-150 price bracket lately, so it's difficult to find direct comparisons to the LG X Power as far as camera quality goes. The 2015 Moto G is now available for around $150, so it's a decent point of comparison even if it has been replaced by a newer but not really better model. In this situation, the LG X Power's image quality leaves much to be desired. The overall sharpness isn't really any better than the 5MP Moto E from early 2015, and it's not near as good as the 2015 Moto G with its 13MP IMX 214 sensor from Sony. LG is likely running into ISP limitations as well, but that's what happens when you put an SoC for $50 phones in a $150 phone.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/10515/LGPX3_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Low light photos on the LG X Power actually aren't that bad considering the phone's price. In this scene it's able to hit focus, which is something other phones actually struggle with. There's clearly chroma noise throughout the frame, but detail isn't being washed away by heavy noise reduction like it is in the Moto G4's photo. I think the quality and overall exposure is actually very similar to that of the 2015 Moto G despite the difference in resolution between the two. As far as low-end smartphones go, the LG X Power actually isn't half bad shooting in the dark, although it's not going to be at the level of a $250 smartphone like the Moto G4 Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH5xgZBuZqWfXa16sbvWnqlobQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shawn-ryan-bio-married.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Shawn Ryan?
