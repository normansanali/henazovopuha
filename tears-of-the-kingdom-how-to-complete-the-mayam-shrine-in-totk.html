You’ll need to fix the tower by removing a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zonai block</a> covering the top. Once you have done this and are in the air, turn around, and you’ll see a small collection of Sky Islands you can glide to. Here you’ll find the Shrine and a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zonai Dispenser</a> to pick up some more Zonai Devices.</p><h2>How to Complete the Mayam Shrine in Tears of the Kingdom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zelda_Mayam_Shrine_Crystal_Beam.jpg><p><strong>The Mayam Shrine</strong> is a shrine requires players to <strong>find a green crystal and return it to the Shrine location</strong>. Thankfully, instead of searching aimlessly, you will have a green laser-like line connecting the Shrine to the crystal, making locating it much easier. In this case,<strong> the crystal can be found on a Sky Island just below the one you will find the Shrine on.</strong></p><p data-injection=true>Unfortunately, the crystal is attached to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flux Construct I</a> that you’ll need to deal with. If you haven’t fought one of these minibosses before, you’ll need to use Ultrahand to grab the green cube <strong>somewhere on its body, pull it out, and make the construct fall apart. </strong>Once that’s done, find and<strong> attack the green cube</strong> before it reforms, and repeat this process until it is defeated and you can grab the crystal.</p><p>After beating the Flux Construct, <strong>take the crystal toward the north of Sky Island</strong>. Here you will find <strong>floating Zonai blocks</strong> and some spare rockets scattered around. You’ll want to attach these rockets and the crystal to the Zonai block and launch it toward the Sky Island above you, where the Shrine is located. Make sure you are on the Zonai block first before you send it flying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zelda_Mayam_Shrine_Glider_Zonai_Block.jpg><p>Depending on how far you travel or raise yourself, <strong>you may need to use some additional fans or a glider to reach the Sky Island</strong>. In my case, I used a glider and attached the crystal to the back of it, and glided the last part of the journey.</p><p data-injection=true>Once you are back on the top Sky Island, <strong>take the crystal to the Shrine location,</strong> and you will restore and unlock the Shrine. Now you can enter inside, grab the chest, which will reward you a Magic Rod, and get your Light’s Blessing before heading off to your next adventure.</p><p>And that’s it!
