While Stranger Things is currently on hiatus due to the writers' and actors' strikes, the cast has already received the scripts, and David even knows how the show will end. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84ddc0b8c6e6-david-harbout-winona-ryder-stranger-things.jpg><p id=e2uuXBTQT41 data-wc=46>During an appearance on the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Happy Sad Confused</a> podcast, which was recorded before the SAG-AFTRA strike, the actor said of the scripts: "Before the strike we were sent scripts, they're terrific, as per usual. They continue to outdo themselves, these currently-on-strike writers called the Duffer Brothers."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Stranger Things: when is season 5 being released?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/74744934616a-stranger-things-main-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Stranger Things: when is season 5 being released?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Stranger Things: when is season 5 being released?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eLfGP2Cydgy data-wc=37>Promising an epic season five, he explained: "It's a hell of an undertaking, too. I mean, the set pieces and the things in the scripts that we saw are bigger than anything we've done in the past".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b9d1cacf85ae-stranger-things-eleven-mike-will-and-friends.jpg><p id=eXNbqPLbOpP data-wc=60>Revealing that the fifth instalment will pick up shortly after the events of the season four finale, David revealed: "After where season 4 ended — when you watch us on that hill looking at the ash and the smoke and fires – we're going to start somewhere after that. So you've got to imagine the world is a different place."</p><p id=ePv3u2JbxCk data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Millie Bobby Brown looks like a Disney princess on date with fiancé Jake Bongiovi</a></p><p id=eMUyNsrqP0 data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Shelter: fans are saying same thing about Harlan Coben drama</a></p><p id=eoL-FGs_L8a data-wc=84>"And it's great, it'll take a while to shoot which will be tough since we can't get started now but it is what it is. I'm excited to go back. I'm excited to wrap it up in a bold, amazing way. I'm excited to really swing with this character, because you know they're going to pay off these OG characters: Eleven, Hopper, Joyce, Will, Mike; they're going to pay them off in big ways because they've lived with you for the past eight years."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7dbadc6c46c7-stranger-things-season-four-hawkins-in-chaos.jpg><p id=eO3ZSpTXhYM data-wc=51>Asked whether he knows about the show's ending, David revealed that while he hasn't read the final script, he knows how the series will wrap up. "I know what it is. I know where we net out and it's very, very moving," he said. "That is the term I will use."</p><p id=eoE5-BIfbf7 data-wc=22>Back in November, Stranger Thing's showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer also opened up about the final season in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>IndieWire</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74744934616a-stranger-things-main-d.jpg><p id=eWyEuagrEPc data-wc=71>"It's the same thing with [Season] 5: The most important thing for us is to get it right and not rush it," explained Ross Duffer. "If we've made any mistakes with the show, it's been through rushing. I don't want to take forever — you can't because of the kids, we can't take 10 years. So we gotta move at a decent pace. But our priority is to get it right."</p><p id=eK5oDvFZ4Xh data-wc=40>As for whether any new characters will be introduced, Matt Duffer replied: "We're doing our best to resist [adding new characters] for Season 5. We're trying not to do that so we can focus on the OG characters, I guess."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
