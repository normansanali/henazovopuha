Businesses have been forced to cancel in-store competitions and tournaments as well as pre-release events for new sets, issues only compounded further by delays to&nbsp;Magic‘s latest Standard set, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikora: Lair of Behemoths</a>.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>As a means of attempting to offset some of these unfortunate developments, Wizards has revealed some exclusive cards that you’ll only be able to find by shopping locally. There are two to collect in all and you can check them out below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1589820458_lovelocal.jpg><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>As the image outlines, purchase any Magic-related product at an LGS and you’ll receive a holofoil Reliquary Tower promo card. If you’ve got a little extra cash to burn, picking up any booster box will add a Mechagodzilla, Battle Fortress card to your collection, though only while stocks last. It’s worth noting, too, should you be interested in taking Wizards up on its offer, that each is limited to one per customer, so don’t expect to see many pop up on the secondary market when the promotion begins on June 5th.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>In other news, the latest revision to <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong>‘s Banned & Restricted list was revealed earlier this week, confirming the removal of several Ikoria cards from Legacy formats. See <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for all the details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZopJqfmZh6qK3ToZyroZ6cerOx1Z6YpatdmsWkuNSsoK%2BdXZius7DSZqOorpViuai%2FjKmpqKWfqbawuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-rae-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kendall Rae Net Worth | Husband</span></a>
