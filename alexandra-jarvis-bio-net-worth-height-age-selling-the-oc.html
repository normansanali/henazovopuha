It’s just such bulls**t.”</p><p>Jarvis added to that statement, “I would second that because it’s like if they’re trying to say [Rose is] the pot stirrer, I mean, it’s like Alex Hall made the pot of soup and then gave her the spoon.”</p><p>Others joining her in this 8-episode journey are Alex Hall, Alexandra Rose, Austin Victoria, Brandi Marshall, Gio Helou, Kayla Cardona, Lauren Brito, Polly Brindle, Sean Palmieri, and Tyler Stanaland.</p><h3><strong>Alexandra Jarvis Net Worth</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Alexandra Jarvis should have a net worth of $4 million, according to The Cinemaholic.
