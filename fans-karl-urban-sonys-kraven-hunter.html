It’s unclear what the character’s upcoming solo outing will bring us, but Chandor is a solid filmmaker that’s delivered strong work in a variety of genres including financial thriller Margin Call, survival drama All is Lost and crime story A Most Violent Year, making him an intriguingly exciting choice to helm a big budget superhero pic with a bad guy in the lead.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Of course, Keanu Reeves is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost guaranteed to show up in a Marvel blockbuster</a> at some stage in the near future, but Kraven the Hunter shouldn’t be it. Instead, fans have named Karl Urban as their preferred candidate to bring the character into live-action for the first time, and you can check out some of the reactions below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Listen I love Keanu Reeves but Karl Urban would be an excellent choice to play Kraven and I’m prepared to die alone on this hill <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nMM0zFo9FL</a></p><p>— Nerd Girl Says (@Rachael_Conrad) <a href=#>February 8, 2021</a></p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false></p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/zeldawilliams/status/1358865487745011712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358865487745011712%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.small-screen.co.uk%2Ffans-think-karl-urban-should-play-kraven-the-hunter%2F</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/MorganlBrooks/status/1358902452758712321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1358902452758712321%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.small-screen.co.uk%2Ffans-think-karl-urban-should-play-kraven-the-hunter%2F</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would ADORE Karl Urban as Kraven.
