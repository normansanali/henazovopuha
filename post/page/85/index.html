Part I
[Verse 1: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah
Kept the Galleria open ’til ten for you and your friends
You know how I spend in H-O-U-S-T-O-N
I get too crazy, had a little baddina
We stay good friends, we get too wavy
All I know is that when this cup ends, the next one begins
My bae, you know me and you knew me back then
And you know how it goes when I see you again</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michelle Yeoh pays tribute to late Disney star CoCo Lee</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>
