Suck and suck.
Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck.
Workin up under my patience like a little tick.
Fat little parasite.
Suck me dry.
My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards.
You have turned my blood cold and bitter,
beat my compassion black and blue.
Hope this is what you wanted.
Hope this is what you had in mind.
Cuz this is what you’re getting.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vir Das Wiki, Height, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Jul 13, 2024</time>
