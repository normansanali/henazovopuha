Perez was arrested outside his Mount Vernon home on June 29, 2021, the day after the shooting.&nbsp;</p><p>He later pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and second-degree assault on Thursday, Aug. 17. After his prison sentence is finished, he will be subject to five years of supervised release.&nbsp;</p><p>During sentencing proceedings, Salazar's wife read a victim impact statement to the court: "Imagine waking up the next day and telling your kids they will never be able to see, hear, touch, talk, or hug their dad again. Manuel was the most loving husband.... Losing him has changed my life forever.”&nbsp;</p><p>Westchester District Attorney Miriam Rocah also condemned the murder, saying, "This senseless act of gun violence took away a father and husband leaving a family devastated. We must be vigilant in our fight to keep guns out of the hands of people who use them for harm.”&nbsp;</p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Tarrytown-SleepyHollow and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBksqeioHy1rdGrsK2np6N8rq3NZqqhp5%2BpwG63yKWjrGWWlsGpsdFmpp9lYmKutXnSpZyeqKlitbC4y6iuZqiRp7hutMSrnKxlmJ7Abr%2FEp6ueppOaerV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrica-okano.html><span>←</span><span>Lyrica Okano - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, In Relation, Facts</span></a>
