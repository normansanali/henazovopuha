This will open your User Settings.</p><p>From here, scroll down until you see "Window Settings" on the left-hand side of the screen. Click on it.</p><p>Under Window Settings is a section titled "System Startup Behavior." If you don't want Discord to start up when you open your computer, make sure "Open Discord" is deselected.</p><p>If you don't mind Discord opening when you open your computer, you also have the option to set the app so that it doesn't open a window on your desktop, but sets the app to run in the background. If you want to do this, just make sure "Start Minimized" is selected.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">You can disable Discord's autostart in your computer's settings.</h2><p>If you're confused by the above directions, or for some reason Discord continues to start up automatically when you open your computer, then you can change its startup options in your computer's settings instead.</p><p>If you're using a Mac computer, you'll want to start by clicking the apple icon in the upper left corner of your home screen and select "System Preferences."</p><p>Go to "Users & Groups" and then select your profile.

Go to your Task Manager. Once you've opened this application, click the "Startup" tab to see what applications have startup "Enabled" when you start your computer. In this list, right-click "Discord" and then select "Disable."</p><p>Once you've done these steps, you shouldn't have a problem with Discord automatically opening on your computer when you start it up.
