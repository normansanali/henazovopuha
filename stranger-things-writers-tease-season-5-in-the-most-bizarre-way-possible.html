The first season was shrouded by the mystery of the Upside Down, and the entire arc focused on the disappearance of Will Byers. By season four, we had a reasonable idea of what the Upside Down was, and we finally unmasked the puppet master (musical pun intended) behind the strange goings on around Hawkins, Vecna.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>Perhaps, the “baby” of seasons one and four is bringing back some of the mystery and intrigue of season one (likely with a new MacGuffin or otherwise to chase), while retaining the scale and stakes which were upped in season four. Either that, or we can take it literally. Maybe Vecna gets freaky with a demogorgon, and out comes BeelzeBob. Yes, evil Bob reincarnated from season two. You don’t know!</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>What we do know for certain, is that Stranger Things 5 will mark the end of the road for the mainline Stranger Things series, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">there could be some spin-offs in the works</a> after that’s done and dusted.
