Since their nuptials, the pair welcomed <a href=#>three beautiful kids</a> — Autumn, Atticus and<a href=#>&nbsp;Aidan</a> — and are still going strong.</p><p>The I Know What You Did Last Summer star and Brian first met in 2011 on the set of NBC’s pilot Love Bites.&nbsp;The following year, the two reconnected and became a couple when they portrayed exes on The Client List in 2012. After dating for more than a year, Jennifer and Brian tied the knot in a private ceremony in November 2013.</p><p>The Ghost Whisperer star adores stepping out with her handsome hubby for a fun night out on the town, but Jennifer dished she actually prefers being at home with Brian. In March 2020, the loving wife revealed they had a <a href=#>romantic date night under the stars</a>.</p><p>“Got to have a moment with my love tonight. Just us watching the light fade and it was perfect,” the Heartbreakers star wrote on social media. “The wine was really good. We have to breathe and take a moment. So important in all the craziness. Lucky to be married to my guy.”</p><p>Even though no relationship is perfect, Jennifer doesn’t regret any moment she’s shared with the Revenge actor. “The best thing I have ever done will always be marrying him, having our kids and watching them change and grow every day,” the mom of three — who welcomed her <a href=#>youngest child, Aidan</a>, in September 2021 — once gushed on Instagram.</p><p>However, the best thing about Brian is that the actress can always count on him. During a February 2019 interview with <a href=#>Working Mother</a>, Jennifer recalled a time her hubby calmed her down by giving her the best pep talk of her life.</p><p>“[He said,] ‘Love you, but you can’t be like this. Not sure who I’m supposed to be taking care of right now,’” she shared. By saying those words, it made the Party of Five star love her guy even more. Jennifer showed the world exactly how much she cherishes Brian by giving him a sweet shout-out for their seventh wedding anniversary.</p><p>“Seven years today married to the man of my dreams. Seven years no itch,” Jennifer penned <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> in November 2020. “Feeling very grateful.”</p><p><span>In October 2021, Jennifer shared a photo of her beloved in honor of his birthday. “Halloween was always one of my favorite holidays. And then I got to marry a Halloween baby!” she wrote. “Celebrating you is the greatest thing we get to [do] today, my love. You make our lives brighter every day and I feel so lucky to be yours and for our kids to have the best daddy! Happy Birthday </span><span>to our whole world!”</span></p><p><span>A few months later, the “How Do I Deal” singer posted a throwback photo with her hubby to celebrate Valentine’s Day in 2022. “We were babies. Now we have babies. My forever Valentine. Love you B,” she captioned the Instagram post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Scroll below to learn five fun facts about Jennifer’s soulmate, Brian!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hlmah6q7HNp6CfnaJiubDCxGafnq%2BZqcG0eceuqpuZnpl6dnnFmpqtq12Wr7DB02aZq6GRo3qprculoKyZqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./most-expensive-pens-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 Most Expensive Pens In The World (2022)</span></a>
