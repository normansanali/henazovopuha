He’s just a wonderful guy. He’s a comedian, so there’s never a dull moment! And all of his friends are just so fun because they’re just as fun and unique and complex as he is.”</p><p>Saget was previously married to attorney Sherri Kramer.

I mean, Kelly and my daughters love each other, so it really is some magical thing that happened. They just love each other. And we want to enjoy the love of each other, so that’s something that we want to do,” the Fuller House star told Us in April. “I’ve been the dad a lot. Maybe I’ll be a grandfather one day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafrZyheqm71KycrGWSpK9uv8CgnK1lnZa%2Fs7XErGSknZyhxm6%2ByLOxqGWjmrJuw8Sdm6Kml2K9qbvTqKpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cree-cicchino-2.html><span>←</span><span>Cree Cicchino Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</span></a>
