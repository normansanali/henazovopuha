How rich Georgia Engel is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Georgia Engel’s net worth, as of mid-2017, revolves around the sum of $8 million, acquired through her acting career which is currently spanning over 45 years, being active since 1971.</p><h3>Georgia Engel Net Worth $8 million</h3><p>Georgia was born as the younger daughter of Ruth Caroline and Benjamin Franklin Engel. She is the sister of Robin Ruth Engel who won the 1967 Miss Hawaii pageant. Georgia went to Kodiak Island Borough School District in Alaska – her father was in the US Coast Guard – before attending Walter Johnson High School. She later enrolled at the Academy of the Washington Ballet as well as the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, from which she obtained her degree. Upon graduation Engel moved to Washington D.C. where she joined the American Light Opera Company. In 1969 she relocated to New York City and subsequently became involved in several off-Broadway productions such as “Lend an Ear” and “The House of Blue Leaves”. In December 1969, Georgia made her debut Broadway appearance in the theater production of “Hello, Dolly”. All these ventures provided the basis for Georgia Engel’s net worth, and set the foundation for her acting career.</p><p>She debuted on the big screen in 1971 when she was cast for a supporting role of Margot in <a href=#>Miloš Forman’s</a> English-language debut, the comedy movie “Taking Off”, for which performance, Georgia was rewarded with a nomination for the prestigious BAFTA Award. In 1972 she appeared in the French thriller “The Outside Man” before landing the memorable role of Georgette Franklin Baxter in “The Mary Tyler Moore” TV series. This role, which she portrayed ’til 1977 when the show was cancelled, brought Engel two consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations, in 1976 and 1977. It is certain that all these engagements helped Georgia Engel to establish herself as a young, prominent actress as well as to massively boost her net worth as well.</p><p>Ever since, she has maintained a continuous streak of acting engagements, primarily in TV series, adding a handful of memorable roles to her acting portfolio, including Loretta Smoot in “Goodtime Girls”, Susan Elliot in “Jennifer Slept Here” as well as Shirley Burleigh in “Coach” and Pat MacDougall in “Everybody Loves Raymond” – the latter role earned her nominations for Primetime Emmy Award three years in a row, between 2003 and 2005 as well as two consecutive Gold Derby Awards, in 2004 and 2005. Some other small screen appearances include “Passions”, “Two and a Half Men” and the recurring role of Mamie Sue Johnson in TV Land’s sitcom “Hot in Cleveland”. Doubtlessly, all these accomplishments helped Georgia Engel to dramatically increase the total size of her wealth.</p><p>Apart from her on-camera appearances, in 2006 Georgia starred in the Broadway musical production “The Drowsy Chaperone”, while between 2004 and 2010 she occasionally appeared in several productions of The Muny Theater. Georgia also voice acted in several motion pictures of the “Open Season” franchise. It is certain that all these achievements have helped Georgia Engel to add a significant sum to her net worth.</p><p>When it comes to her personal life, Georgia Engel has managed to keep it private – there aren’t any relevant data about her private matters or affairs, except that she has never married.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.20993227991><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Georgia Engel</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$8 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 28, 1948</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington, District of Columbia, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 6" (1.68 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Soundtrack</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Walter Johnson High School, University of Hawaii at Manoa</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Benjamin Franklin Engel, Ruth Caroline Hendron</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Robin Ruth Engel</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0257077/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Obie Award for Performance</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series</td></tr><tr readability=19><td>Movies</td><td>The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Open Season, Grown Ups 2, The Betty White Show, Goodtime Girls, Jennifer Slept Here, Open Season 2, The Care Bears Movie, The Outside Man, Open Season 3, The Sweetest Thing, Signs of Life, Taking Off, A Love Affair: The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story, The Day The Women Got E...</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Jennifer Slept Here, The Betty White Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Goodtime Girls</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Her voice</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=6.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=8><td>1</td><td>As a young teenager when I was attending ballet school, my teacher told me I'd never be a ballerina and I was never much of a singer, but I continued to get leading roles in musical theatre because of the comedy.
