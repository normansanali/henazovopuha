She resides in a Kansas City mansion valued at $<strong>1.9 million</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.sportsbrief.com/images/1120/b325e1e6a0b3397d.jpeg><p>She has two kids and a daughter who reside with her in the 2,759 square foot home. The home that Randi’s ex-husband bought in the beginning of 2019 has three bedrooms with three bathrooms, a kitchen, the main bedroom, a swimming pool, and a hot tub.</p><h2>Age and Nationality</h2><p>When this story was last updated and posted on Thrill NG, Martin was 50 years old. She identified as Caucasian and had Cancer as her zodiac or birth sign. She was also born in Texas, which automatically grants her citizenship in the United States.</p><h3>Family</h3><p>Her mother’s name is Bance Martin, while her father’s name is Debbie Bates, as determined by our team of writers. She had a decent childhood because her parents belonged to the middle class in the American economy.</p><h2>What is the Professional Career of Randi Martin?</h2><p>Information on Randi’s professional history was lacking when this page was last updated and published on Thrill NG. Other than that, a few reports claimed she is a homemaker. In Texas, Randi organized events and participated in charitable causes. She participated in a fundraising event for Variety KC while celebrating one of her birthdays.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Screen-Shot-2023-02-05-at-6.18.50-PM.png><p>Whatever the case, she might have chosen a new career when she split from her now-divorced husband. Randi Martin may have chosen a different career at the time, but one of her occupations may have been being the mother of a well-known National Football League (NFL) player.</p><p>As it were, her son Patrick Mahomes signed a contract on July 6, 2020, for $503 million, which included a base salary of $477 million and a potential bonus of $26 million. This ten-year contract extension has Pat Mahomes under contract through the 2031 campaign.</p><h2>Randi Martin – Spouse, Marriage, and Divorce</h2><p>After dating the American baseball star Pat Mahomes for a while and getting married to him in the 1990s, Randi and Pat parted ways in 2006; their divorce was eventually formalized as a result of what sources referred to as a “misunderstanding.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1yV6NezesEjWOoWqr7s1EilvDoY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x404:1021x406)/patrick-mahomes-family-1-e73ed86355164c2993662616ce9bad76.jpg"><p>Even though the couple is no longer married, they are still legally bound to Patrick Mahomes II, the child they had together. Patrick was therefore born to the Mahomes family on September 17, 1995.</p><p>Additionally, Randi has two more children after her divorce from her husband is finalized, making her a single mother. Jackson Martin was born in 2000, and Mia Martin was from a previous relationship. Jackson Martin is now a single mother of three.</p><h2>Body Measurement: Height and Weight</h2><p>The last time Randi weighed herself, she was 67 kg and stood roughly five feet eight inches above the ground. She has fair skin, brown eyes, and blonde hair, therefore she has all three of those features. The single mother, once married, has a good physical shape despite her non-vegetarian eating habits. For her age, she appears to be in good shape and health.</p><strong><strong>you may also like </strong></strong><a href=# rel=bookmark>Gloria Darlene Fox.</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKqRo7Gqecyaqa2hnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokmon-tcg-reveals-amazing-rare-cards-upcoming-set.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon TCG Reveals New Amazing Rare Cards For Upcoming Set</span></a>
