1. MrBeast Unsurprisingly, the number-one channel on YouTube is among the wealthiest there. While MrBeast claims to put most of his wealth back towards his YouTube content, there’s no doubt that MrBeast has turned his independent content creation into a money-making machine."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

MrBeast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the number-one channel on YouTube is among the wealthiest there. While <strong><a href=#>MrBeast</a></strong> claims to put most of his wealth back towards his YouTube content, there’s no doubt that MrBeast has turned his independent content creation into a money-making machine.</p><p><strong><a href=#>MrBeast</a></strong>’s success is undoubtedly down to his immediately marketable viral content, which ranges from recreations of popular trends—such as his episode recreating Squid Game—to other gameshow like challenges that reward his contestants with big bucks.</p><p><strong><a href=#>MrBeast</a></strong> has also gone far beyond YouTube, last year even partnering with 1,600 restaurants across America to sell <strong><a href=#>MrBeast</a></strong> branded food, splitting the profits from 5 million sales with the restaurants themselves.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_Jake_Paul></span>2. Jake Paul<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Love him or hate him, <strong><a href=#>Jake Paul</a></strong> has been around the YouTube scene for a long time and has understandably profited greatly from it. Whether it be his personal vlogs or his heavily publicized endeavors in boxing, <strong><strong><strong><a href=#>Jake Paul</a></strong></strong></strong> has become a household name.</p><h3>Read Also!!</h3><p>Arguably, <strong><a href=#>Jake Paul</a></strong>’s initial downfall was, in fact, down to one of his brother’s videos—<strong><a href=#>Logan Paul</a></strong> being another popular YouTube vlogger at the time. The video of the Japanese Suicide Forest saw immediate backlash, which saw their sponsors cut them out and YouTube demonetize them overnight. While both are now able to once again earn money from the platform himself, <strong><a href=#>Jake Paul</a></strong> has pivoted to focus on boxing full-time. But chances are, he’ll be back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Markiplier></span>3.
