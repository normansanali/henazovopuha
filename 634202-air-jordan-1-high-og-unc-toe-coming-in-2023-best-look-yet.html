Thanks to @sneakertigger and @zsneakerheadz, we now have an in-hand look at the shoe. Initially, the sneaker was simply known through photoshop renderings. However, we now have actual pictures of the sneaker. Overall, it looks amazing as powder blue mixes with black and white. This is simply one of those timeless looks that fans will always enjoy. Simply put, it is very difficult to hate something that looks like this.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for the actual release date, it has been rumored that these will drop on July 8th. However, this release date has not yet been confirmed. There is still a lot of time before these get released, so expect some changes along the way. Until then, be sure to stay tuned to HNHH for the latest news and updates from around the sneaker world.
