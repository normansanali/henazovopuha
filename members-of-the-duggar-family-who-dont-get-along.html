Keep it up!"&nbsp;she <a href=#>tweeted at him</a> after his <a href=#>scandalous Christmastime Instagram Q&A</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hollywood Gossip</a>, Amy later recorded an interview with the reality TV vlog <a href=#>Without A Crystal Ball</a>, however, the video was quickly "marked private" after Amy allegedly said that an undisclosed person threatened her with a lawsuit. "In other words? Jim Bob totally pulled some strings, made some calls and got Amy silenced," The Hollywood Gossip inferred. Without naming her uncle, Amy confirmed the effort to keep her quiet, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, "I've said it once, I'll say it again...A [woman's] voice should never be silenced."</p><p>In his own interview with <a href=#>Without A Crystal Ball</a>, Derick said it's a shame that Amy is being prevented from speaking her truth. If Amy was even remotely on the outs with the Duggars, crossing the line to Derick's side of this family argument has probably assured that their relationship will get worse before it ever gets better.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hka4V3e8yepJudoqh6sLKMrZ%2BeZZSqtKit0WadmqWZocZuw8eoZJ2nnql6qLHTZpilp56cfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-upton-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Upton Net Worth 2024</span></a>
