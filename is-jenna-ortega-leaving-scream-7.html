In the wake of the news, director Christopher Landon tweeted, in a now-deleted post, “This is my statement: Everything sucks.&nbsp;Stop yelling.&nbsp;This was not my decision to make.”</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Because of this, and the well-known closeness between the cast of the contemporary Scream movies, there is much confusion over whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Ortega</a>, Barrera’s on-screen sister, will return for Scream 7 or not. Here’s what we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-jenna-ortega-leaving-scream-7-in-solidarity-with-melissa-barrera data-injectable=false>Is Jenna Ortega leaving Scream 7 in solidarity with Melissa Barrera?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scream-vi-core-four-1.jpg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>On Nov. 22, 2023, less than 24 hours after Barrera was let go, it was reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> that Jenna Ortega will not be returning for Scream 7 as Tara Carpenter, the younger sibling of Barrera’s Sam Carpenter, who replaced Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott as the franchise’s lead for 2022’s Scream and 2023’s Scream VI.</p><p data-characters=669 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Deadline states that sources tell them Ortega was already planning to split from the sequel prior to the strikes. With a script from Scream 7 yet to be handed in, and with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday season 2 due to film</a> in Ireland in summer 2024, scheduling conflicts have been cited as the reason for her exit. However, despite this, much conjecture and speculation continues to spread on social media that the Beetlejuice 2 actress is really stepping away in solidarity with Barrera. Prior to Deadline’s report, various <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors and uncorroborated claims</a> suggested Ortega was looking to get out of her contract for Scream 7 due to her unhappiness with her co-star’s firing.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>The same is also being said of Barrera and Ortega’s colleagues, Jasmin Savoy Brown and Mason Gooding, who are likewise confirmed to return as Mindy and Chad Meeks-Martin, although at this juncture they remain attached. Clearly, director/writer Landon will have to completely change the script to accommodate Barrera’s firing and Ortega’s exit, but if all four leads walked from the picture, Spyglass might be forced to either rethink the project from the ground up or cancel it. Or, as fans would prefer, renege on its decision to let Barrera go.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>Social media campaigns such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#justiceformelissabarrera</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">#boycottscream7</a> are gaining significant steam, so the loss of a huge draw like Jenna Ortega is yet another stab to the gut for Scream 7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnJnqWnmV2kv7WxxppkpZ2Rq7avs4ysmqudkaJ6eHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./austin-butler-reacts-to-kaia-gerbers-ex-jacob-elordis-elvis-movie.html><span>←</span><span>Austin Butler Reacts to Kaia Gerber's Ex Jacob Elordi's Elvis Movie</span></a>
