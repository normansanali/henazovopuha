In the now accessible room, in the immediate left corner, is a Jackdaw’s Clue scroll on a pedestal.</span></p><h2>Did Richard Jackdaw love Anne?</h2><p>Richard attended Hogwarts and was known to be a heartbreaker. While he had shown interest in Apollonia Black, Apollonia showed no interest in him. He later on wooed and fell in love with Anne Thisbe.</p><h2>Is there anyway to save Anne Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>This NPC quest line has left many players wondering if they will eventually be able to save Anne from her curse the further they progress in Sebastian’s side narrative. Unfortunately, players will not be able to save Anne. However, they will be able to save Sebastian from spending the rest of his life in Azkaban.</p><h2>What happens to Anne Sallow in Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>Anne was the only participant at the funeral of Solomon Sallow. After Solomon’s murder, Anne moved elsewhere. Her exact location was never disclosed in her letter to Sebastian, and her eventual fate is unknown.</p><h2>What happened to Anne Thisbe in Harry Potter legacy?</h2><p>She was found guilty of Jackdaw’s murder and sent to Azkaban where she was held for multiple decades.</p><h2>Find what Jackdaw left for Anne Hogwarts Legacy</h2><h2>Is there a cure for Anne Sallow?</h2><p>Anne Sallow was never cured, Solomon Sallow was senselessly murdered, and it was unlikely that Sebastian Sallow ever recovered from what he had done.</p><h2>Can you stop Sebastian from killing his uncle?</h2><p>There is no way to block the spell, and there is no counter-curse – it can only be dodged.</p><h2>Can Anne Swallow be cured Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>Solomon Sallow: “There is no cure.</p><h2>Is Sebastian Sallow evil?</h2><p>Sebastian used to be a sassy and charismatic young boy, but he was turned into a killer who didn’t seem to realize the gravity of his situation – innocent as a child- still thinks ends justify the means and that his sister will forgive him.</p><h2>Was Anne Sallow a Slytherin?</h2><p>Anne Sallow was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts before an unknown illness made it so horrible that she couldn’t continue attending.</p><h2>Should you send Sebastian to Azkaban?</h2><p>Beyond some disapproving dialogue from other characters, there are no downsides to learning Avada Kedavra or other Unforgivable Curses from Sebastian, making it preferable to not turn him in.</p><h2>Do I turn Sebastian in?</h2><p>Aside from the Unforgivable Curses, there are no missables associated with this decision, so players are free to choose whatever outcome they like without fear of missing out on anything important.</p><h2>Why did Rookwood curse Anne?</h2><p>Likewise, Rookwood cursing Anne instead of simply killing her seems like it was a choice that would keep her alive in order for the events of this relationship questline to occur.</p><h2>How did jackdaw lose his head Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>However, she never showed up and he became upset, thinking she had blown him off. He continued on without her, following the map into the cave, but just as he got into the central part, his head was suddenly cut off, killing him instantly.</p><h2>Can you go to Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>Visiting Azkaban in Hogwarts Legacy is only an option for players who chose a particular House at the start of the game, and it is only a very brief and linear visit, but it’s still exciting to see and walk around such a storied locale, even briefly.</p><h2>What happened to Richard Jackdaw?</h2><p>Richard Jackdaw is one of the Other NPCs in Hogwarts Legacy. Richard Jackdaw is a former student at Hogwarts who was killed by decapitation while seeking adventure.</p><h2>Should I choose Sebastian or Natty?</h2><p>However, overall this is not one of the biggest choices in Hogwarts Legacy that matters long-term. Whomever you wind up choosing, it will be largely inconsequential to the overall story as well as the outcome of the trip to Hogsmeade, only impacting the conversations you have there.</p><h2>What happens to Sebastian Sallow if you turn him in?</h2><p>If you turn Sebastian in, he will be expelled from Hogwarts and you will not be able to interact with him again in the game. This means that, if he hasn’t already taught you the Unforgivable Curses, now he never will. He will be taken to the Ministry of Magic to face justice.</p><h2>Is it ok to tell sebastian sallow the truth?</h2><p>In the end, players should opt for whichever option they feel fits their character best, as there is no real difference between withholding or telling Sebastian the truth in Hogwarts Legacy. Editor’s Note: Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling has been accused of transphobia by those in the LGBTQ+ community.</p><h2>Should I trust Sebastian Swallow?</h2><p>In the end, players should opt for whichever option they feel fits their character best, as there is no real difference between withholding or telling Sebastian the truth in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><h2>Why is Anne cursed Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>Hogwarts Legacy’s Victor Rookwood and Ranrok pillage through Feldcroft in the present day while searching for these Dark Magic reserves, and therefore Anne’s ailment and the Sallow’s subsequent tragedies are the direct result of Isidora’s unchecked ambition.</p><h2>Does Sebastian cure his sister?</h2><p>Overall, the plot was a failure. Anne Sallow was never cured, Solomon Sallow was senselessly murdered, and it was unlikely that Sebastian Sallow ever recovered from what he had done.</p><h2>Can Professor Fig be saved?</h2><p>Any option you chose results in the same boss fight against Ranrok, and Professor Fig dying. There’s no way to save him even if you made the “good” decisions.</p><h2>What happens if you snitch on Sebastian?</h2><p>If you turn Sebastian in, he will be expelled from Hogwarts and you will not be able to interact with him again in the game.</p><h2>What is the good ending in Hogwarts Legacy?</h2><p>In Hogwarts Legacy’s good ending, players will struggle alongside Professor Fig to contain the magic as the room crumbles around them. Eventually, they succeed and are able to seal away ancient magic for good.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eaq2aikZi4pa3WZqOenqRis7C%2BjJqlp51dnbyow8Crq6xlnJq0oq%2FYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-best-case-to-protect-your-sports-cards.html><span>←</span><span>What is the Best Case to Protect Your Sports Cards?</span></a>
