But I wrote this scary novel for teenagers Blind Date, and it was number one on the publishers weekly bestseller list. Then a year later I wrote another one and it was a bestseller, and I thought wait a minute, I’ve stumbled on to something here that kids want to read.” - R. L. Stine on why he decided to write scary stories.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nppm60kcyjf84bvxdmo12@published data-word-count=86>“I didn’t want to mess up Fear Street, and didn’t want to confuse the audience or make them younger, but finally said OK if I could think of a good name for the series. One day I was reading the tv-listings and it said “It is Goosebumps week on channel 11” because they were showing scary movies. I just stared at that name and thought it was perfect. It’s scary and it is funny.” - R. L. Stine on how he got the idea for Goosebumps.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nppm60kczjf847r6sj7qy@published data-word-count=70>“No one ever dies. Goosebumps has to be this fun fantasy. That is my rule. Kid’s can go and say “Well this could never happen’ and that is what makes it safe. It is not going to go to far. This is a very scary world for kids, but I leave out anything real that would really be troubling for kids.” - R. L. Stine on the thought behind Goosebumps.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0nppm60kd0jf84cau9g54p@published data-word-count=35>This episode is brought to you by Squarespace: everything you need to create an exceptional website.
