For that makeover, the sides of Scott’s head were also buzzed. Instead of short blonde hair, though, the father of three sported a much longer mohawk that was dyed a bright pink shade. <a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by 𝐌𝐈𝐀𝐌𝐈 𝐁𝐀𝐑𝐁𝐄𝐑 𝘓𝘜𝘐𝘚 𝘙𝘐𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘈 🇵🇷 (@elboribarber)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Scott first made the switch to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bubblegum hair</a> in early February.

Clearly, the E! star was getting bored of his brunette hair. Scott’s temporary pink phase between his two blonde dye jobs, however, was a spontaneous decision, according to Miami-based celebrity barber <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Luis Rivera</strong></a>. At the time, Scott simply wanted to touch up his already blonde hair. <a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-9></p></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A post shared by 𝐌𝐈𝐀𝐌𝐈 𝐁𝐀𝐑𝐁𝐄𝐑 𝘓𝘜𝘐𝘚 𝘙𝘐𝘝𝘌𝘙𝘈 🇵🇷 (@elboribarber)</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Scott Disick’s bright pink hair makeover from Feb. 2021.
