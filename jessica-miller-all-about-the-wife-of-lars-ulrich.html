<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Jessica Miller- All About The Wife Of Lars Ulrich</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Lars Ulrich’s third time is the charm</strong>. Metallica’s drummer discovered a love for the third time in the arms of his third wife, Jessica Miller. It’s unclear when the couple met, and their relationship history is hazy. However, it has been alleged that the two met in October 2012. After that, the couple dated for nine months until becoming engaged in July 2013. Their engagement and bachelor parties were well-publicized. According to People, several renowned faces, including Bradley Cooper, James Hetfield, and Ian McKellen, attended the bachelor party. Ulrich married his third wife in March 2015, after a year of engagement. Since then, the couple has remained together and often shares their story on Instagram.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jessica-miller-is-lars-ulrichs-third-wife></span>Jessica Miller is Lars Ulrich’s third wife.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jessica works in the entertainment sector. She is not a big celebrity like her husband, but she is a model who has worked with numerous well-known companies. Miller is said to have entered the business at the age of 15. She joined a fashion agency at the time, but it wasn’t until she worked with Calvin Klein that she rose to prominence. She allegedly signed a deal with the business when she was around the age of 17/18. Similarly, she has since collaborated with several labels, including Fendi, Givenchy, Gap, Guess, Jimmy Choo, Swaroski, Tommy Hilfiger, and Miss Sixty.</p><p>Similarly, she has been on the covers of several prestigious magazines, including Vogue Paris, Harper’s Bazaar, and Elle. Miller has also gained recognition for her abilities. In 2003, she was named ‘Model of the Year’ at the International Photographer Awards. She triumphed against a slew of other brilliant models, including Kate Moss and Carmen Kass. Miller, on the other hand, is quite low-key about her modeling profession these days. She is presently under the management of Next Management and Iconic Management. However, she is not as active as she once was. Regardless, she continues to showcase her figure on social media. She often tweets photos of herself wearing a bikini and posing surrealistically.</p><p>She has also worked alongside her spouse on many occasions. Ulrich told Vogue in 2016 that he loved photography and had taken images of his wife for several projects. Miller is not just a model but also an activist. She is very enthusiastic about animals and often mentions that she is involved with several animal welfare groups. Furthermore, she has worked with Animal Place, a non-profit organization that aids animals, to generate funds for them. She also has a contribution link in her Instagram profile, urging her friends and followers to pay a little amount to support animals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lars-ulrich-and-jess-millers-previous-relationships></span>Lars Ulrich and Jess Miller’s previous relationships<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before they met, Ulrich and Miller were both in committed relationships. Before Miller, the Metallica drummer was married twice and had one meaningful relationship. Debbie Jones was his first wife, and they were married for two years, from 1988 to 1990. In 1997, he married actress Skyler Satenstein, whom he married seven years later. Unfortunately, their marriage did not endure seven years and ended in divorce. Ulrich was in a relationship with Connie Nielsen from 2004 to 2012.</p><p>They weren’t engaged or married, but they were in a live-in relationship with a son. Miller, on the other hand, has just two public romances.&nbsp;She dated Brandon Boyd and was even engaged to him at one point. However, the couple did not marry. Miller was also in a relationship with Daron Malakian, although nothing is known about Miller’s personal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKVqMCqr8BmpKKknJq%2Fbq3LpWSamp%2BqwW7Ax55ksKGWmnqwsoylmKurXaq5s7XCoWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-spell-succeed.html><span>←</span><span>How to spell succeed</span></a>
