Columbus had heard about Jamaica from natives on modern-day Cuba. They claimed that Jamaica was an island of gold. Columbus never found gold on Jamaica, but he did claim it for the Spanish Empire, calling it Santiago. In its early days, Jamaica served as a supply base for Spaniards. In 1655, the English attacked Spaniards on Jamaica and claimed the island for themselves. Under English rule, Jamaica became an economically and politically important island in the Western Hemisphere.</p><h2>1979: Margaret Thatcher Becomes The First Female Prime Minister Of Great Britain</h2><p>Britain’s Conservative Party defeats the Labour Party by winning a majority in the House of Commons during parliamentary elections, making Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher the first female prime minister.

Police arrested Clarence Busch for Lightner’s death and soon discovered that he’d been involved in several other drunk driving incidents, including one less than a week before he hit Lightner. Cari’s mother Candy then founded MADD to take action against what she called “the only socially accepted form of homicide.”</p><h2>2007: Madeleine McCann Goes Missing</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-421317 alt="Madeleine McCann" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/madeleine-mccann.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-421317 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Madeleine McCann shortly before her disappearance in 2007.</span></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Madeleine McCann</a>, a three-year-old girl from England, goes missing while on vacation with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal.
