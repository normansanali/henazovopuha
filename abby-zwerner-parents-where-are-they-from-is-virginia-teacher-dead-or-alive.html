However, she was left seriously injured after the altercation.</span></p><p><span>Authorities say Zwerner has shown signs of improvement. The teacher suffered life-threatening injuries after the child shot her with a handgun on Friday, January 8.</span></p><p><span>Mayor Phillip Jones, who took office five days ago, told the&nbsp;</span><span>BBC</span><span> that Ms. Zwerner was improving, and her recovery was “trending in a positive direction.”</span></p><p><span>But Mr. Jones added that she remained in a critical condition following the incident.</span></p><p><span>Social media users wished Ms. Zwerner a speedy recovery. Her alma mater, James Madison University, sent “prayers and best wishes for her health and recovery.”</span></p><p><span>Authorities said the school had metal detection facilities, but students were checked randomly, and not every child was inspected.</span></p><p><span>It is unclear how the child, who remains in Police custody, obtained the gun and why he committed the crime.</span></p><p><span>Chief Steve Drew only mentioned that the shooting took place after an “altercation” in a first-grade classroom (ages six to seven), did not appear to be “accidental,” and did not involve anyone else.</span></p><p><span>“We do not have all the answers about how a six-year-old handled a firearm or access a firearm,” Mayor Jones said.</span></p><p><span>He cited the day as “a dark day in our history and a red flag for the country.”</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=abby-zwerner-the-virginia-teacher-hailed-as-a-hero></span><span>Abby Zwerner: The Virginia Teacher Hailed As A Hero</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Steve Gonzalez, whose child was also present in the classroom, told Fox News that Ms. Zwerner had reacted selflessly after the shooting.</span></p><p><span>Mr. Gonzalez said, “she screamed at her kids to run away” after being struck by the bullet.</span></p><p><span>George Parker, School District Superintendent, said the incident showed how we must educate our children and keep them safe.</span></p><p><span>Officers have also declined to discuss why the student did what he did and what contact they have had with his parents.</span></p><p><span>Virginia law prevents six-year-olds from being tried as adults. If found guilty, the child would be too young to be committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice’s custody.</span></p><p><span>However, a judge could revoke the parents’ custody of the boy and transfer him into the supervision of the state.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>Lisa Wishart Illness And Health Update: How Did Managing Director Of Lisini Pub Company Die?</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmSl8ZuxtaeqaedomK9or7Ep6usZaedsrOxjJqpnmWknbK6ecWrpqZlmah6t7XRoKCnoZFiwaatwqGcq2WUmq6lec6rZJqkmauycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ginny-georgia-season-2-behind-the-scenes-scrapped-olivia-rodrigo-reference-html.html><span>←</span><span>'Ginny &amp;amp; Georgia' Season 2 Behind-the-Scenes Footage Reveals Scrapped Olivia Rodrigo Reference</span></a>
