He was having a YouTube Conversation for The Mental Health Collection.</p><p>At that time, Zach confessed that he is bisexual now. He also revealed that he was straight all his life and had liked only women until now.</p><p>But when he appeared on the show Big Brother in 2014, things changed in his life. He got very close to Frankie Grande who is the big brother of American singer <a title="Ariana Grande" href=# rel>Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zr-f.jpg>Zach said:</p><p>“I fell in love with who he was as a person—super funny, super smart, you know, good-looking guy. And as time went on, we got so close that I wasn’t really sure if I had feelings for him or not,”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_couple%E2%80%99s_relationship_after_the_show></span>The couple’s relationship after the show<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Frankie has yet not given any comments or inputs on what Zach has just revealed on the podcast. Zach also went on to say that after the show ended and everyone went home, his relationship with Frankie was more than that of a friend.</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“He was the first guy that I ever hooked up with. And after that night, I was very unsure about the direction of my sexuality because I like women parts,”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zr-sr.jpg>After this period in his life, he was uncertain of his sexuality. He did not know where to go from there. He added:</p><p>“I don’t want to say I tried—being gay, but I watched gay pornography and I was like, ‘Oh that guy, he’s good-looking, he’s hot,’ like would I want to hook up with him? And I’m like, no. Like, I wouldn’t want to make out with him,”</p><p>“So then, I was like, wait a second, is it just because Frankie is someone who I’m really close with?”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zach_and_his_realization></span>Zach and his realization<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The reality TV star revealed that when he went for a photoshoot in New York City, he also hooked up with the photographer. He all the more got confused about his sexuality.</p><p>Zach said:</p><p>“But the more I thought about being with a guy, or like, you know, making out is one thing but doing more than making out with a guy is something I just don’t, I don’t want to do, and like, I’ve never tried it. But I just want to come out and say that I enjoyed hooking up with Frankie and the other guy I hooked up with. Clearly, I enjoyed it because things went down.”</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zr-yt.jpg>The Big Brother alum concluded that he was bisexual with a leaning towards heterosexuality. He wanted to talk about it since he wants to inspire people to remain open-minded.</p><p>He feels that one can get attracted to a person’s mind or heart and hence have a sexual relationship with them.</p><p>Zach added:</p><p>“You don’t have to just be attracted to the way they look.”</p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
