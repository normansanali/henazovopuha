But – oh no – these were the concerns at the forefront of many people’s minds. Never mind the score, what about Serena’s nipples?</p><p>During the match - and Williams’s subsequent<a href=#> quarter final </a>against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova - dozens of Hawkeyed viewers <a href=# rel=nofollow>took to social media to debate</a> the finer points of the 34-year-old’s ‘tight white’ Nike sports top.</p><p>‘I wouldn't usually comment on another woman's body, but could someone give Serena Williams something to cover her nipples...very distracting’, wrote one.</p><p>Another chimed in: ‘With all the money Serena Williams earns, why can’t she buy a decent sports bra which covers her nipples properly?’</p><p>‘Surprised BBC haven’t issued a warning that Serena is showing some nipple today!’ said a third.</p><span></span><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wouldn't usually comment on another woman's body, but could someone give Serena Williams something to cover her nipples...very distracting</p>— Jess C (@CordyCat3456) <a href=#>July 5, 2016</a><p>I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. After all, Williams has only won Wimbledon six times, broken almost every record going and dominated tennis for more than a decade. Naturally, her chest is the most interesting thing about her.</p><p>Male tennis players change their sweaty shirts on court all the time. Andy Murray did so twice during his<a href=#> quarter-final against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga</a>. No one batted an eyelid - other than a couple of eagle-eyed Twitter users who have, in the past, commented on his ‘curiously tiny nipples’ (they didn’t, however, demand that the BBC issue a warning or that he be forced to bandage his chest).</p><p>Nike, of course, has already been <a href=#>under the spotlight during Wimbledon 2016</a>, for reportedly recalling their official tennis dress.</p><p>We’ve been told it was ‘too skimpy’, although female players apparently complained it was uncomfortable and rode up while they were playing – which is probably the real reason. Yes, many are fashion-conscious, but – as Venus Williams said last week – function is always their primary concern.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>This isn't Carry On Centre Court</span></figure><p>“Female players have opted to wear particularly racy outfits on court this year, including the controversial Nike ‘nightie’," a BBC insider helpfully told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun </a>in response to the Serena tweets. “Producers have absolutely no say in what the players wear, which has made it difficult for them to avoid eye-popping shots on daytime telly.”</p><p>Eye-popping shots? Racy outfits? This isn’t Carry On Centre Court, with Barbara Windsor replaced by Serena Williams for god’s sakes. We’re talking about professional sportswomen. How would you feel if someone body shamed you while you were doing your job? HR would be on the phone within seconds.</p><p>More to the point - would anyone take to Twitter and demand Andy Murray wear thicker shorts because they’d spotted the outline of his testicles?</p><p>Thought not. And until #NewBallsPlease is trending, I suggest you keep any unwanted opinions to yourselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaK%2BforKve8uinZ5nn5t6pLvUq6qeZaOav6a6wGauoqScnq6uv4ynoKmonJrAbq3RnmStoJViurC%2F02agp6yVp7K0wMinnmasmJ67qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./max-sebrechts.html><span>←</span><span>Max Sebrechts</span></a>
