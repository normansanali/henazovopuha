You pick Seth because of the knee thing, but Cody wants to finish the Universal (Title) story.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>McAfee has also said that he did not get a heads-up about competing in the Royal Rumble.
