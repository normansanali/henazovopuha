Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/12/For-Honor-gameplay.jpg><span class="block m-1 ml-0">For Honor cross-play play will let warriors from different platforms do battle or team up.</span><h2>Does For Honor support cross-platform play?</h2><p>The short answer is <strong>it will (fully) soon</strong>. While For Honor didn’t support cross-platform play for a long time, Ubisoft rolled out Phase 1 of their cross-platform plan on March 17, 2022.</p><p>This now allows those playing on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to all enter a shared matchmaking pool for PVP and PVE. This essentially unified the three previous pools into one going forward.</p><p>However, full cross-platform play won’t be possible until the second phase has been completed by Ubisoft. This will allow groups of players across multiple platforms to all take part in PVP and PVE with all players, across all three platforms.</p><p>Ubisoft has confirmed Phase 2 will be rolled out <strong>by the end of 2022</strong>, but no official date has been given yet. We’ll be sure to add it here when it is.</p><p>So, there you have it – that’s everything you need to know about whether or not For Honor is cross-platform.</p><p>For games you can enjoy with friends, check out our other crossplay guides for the biggest multiplayer titles:</p><p><a href=#>Does Diablo Immortal have crossplay?</a> | <a href=#>Does Minecraft&nbsp; support cross-platform play?</a> | <a href=#>Rainbox Six Siege crossplay</a> | <a href=#>Is The Elder Scrolls Online cross-platform</a> | <a href=#>Does Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga support crossplay</a> | <a href=#>Does FIFA 22 have crossplay?</a> | <a href=#>Is Fallout 76 cross-platform?</a> |</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbHXnqmtp16YvK57xpqkoqaXZLa0ecWoqWagn6O8s3nCq6asq12luaLAxaippmWol7y5ec%2BlmLKrpJbBqrvNZqecZWFsfnp%2Blmlm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-janet-jacksons-net-worth-in-2023.html><span>←</span><span>How much is Janet Jacksons Net Worth in 2023</span></a>
