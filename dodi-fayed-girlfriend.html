His <a href=#>relationship</a> with Princess Diana in the late 1990s made the couple famous around the world.</p><p>Tragically, both of them passed away in a Parisian car accident in August 1997. Before their short-lived romance, Dodi was involved with Kelly Fisher, an American-born model whom he dated for several years.</p><p>This part of his life is depicted in Netflix’s “<a href=#>The Crown</a>” season 5 where Erin Richards plays Kelly and highlights Mohamed Al-Fayed’s disapproval of his son’s partner at the time.</p><p>Kelly Fisher and Dodi Fayed met in 1996, a few years before their famous short-lived romance. Kelly, a model from Arizona, had just begun dating the businessman Mohammed al-Fayed when she and Dodi first crossed paths.</p><p>Although their <a href=#>relationship</a> began after his divorce from Suzanne Gregard, some believe that it was part of the reason why their marriage ended.</p><p>At the time, both parties denied any involvement or conflict with one another, but their relationship seemed to progress quickly due to their frequent trips abroad and public appearances together.</p><p>It is said that Kelly’s presence in Dodi’s life is what ultimately led him down the path toward befriending the Princess of Wales.&nbsp;</p><p>This path would ensure that Fisher and Fayed were only significant figures in each other’s lives for a very brief moment before fading into obscurity without much fanfare.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>About Dodi’s ex-fiance Kelly Fisher&nbsp;</h2><p>Kelly’s early years were spent in Louisville, Kentucky, with her family until their relocation due to her father’s job. Despite the change in residency, Kelly set out to pursue a modeling career following summer vacation during her time in high school.&nbsp;</p><p>Her dedication was evident as she managed to work on covers for the likes of Marie Claire and become active in campaigns for legendary fashion houses such as Armani and La Perla.</p><p>Additionally, Kelly was also featured as a model for Victoria’s Secret -a mark of respect and appreciation for any professional model.

Keeping their relationship secret from the world, they secretly dated without revealing any hint to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when The Sunday Mirror revealed k*ssing photos of Dodi and Princess Diana, Kelly knew about their prior relationship.</p><p>While her attorney later claimed that the couple had previously planned to get married as Dodi had gifted a diamond ring to her during their engagement, Dodi’s family denied all allegations regarding his engagement with Kelly Fisher.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Irish Times</a>, A Fayed family spokesman also denied that Fayed promised to marry Fisher. While Dodi Al Fayed’s ex-wife Suzanne Gregard has also questioned Fisher’s account.</p><p>After his death, she said:<strong> “Kelly told me, ‘I’ve broken up with him; I’ve had enough.</strong>‘Like Diana, Dodi was a one-time divorcee.</p><p>Later, Kely’s mother revealed that Dodi asked her permission to marry Kelly in November 1996. When he came to attend Kelly’s sister’s wedding, her mother told the press,<strong>” No one’s daughter deserves to be treated as my daughter was. Kelly loved him, trusted him and has been oppressed by him. Dodi Fayed should be ashamed.”</strong></p><p>In 1986, model Suzanne Gregard married Dodi Fayed, son of a billionaire businessman, but the couple divorced just eight months later.</p><p>Kelly claims she accepted an offer of $500,000 from Dodi to step out of the modeling industry in order to spend more time with him; however, Kelly stated that she only received $60,000 from him before their separation</p><p>She requested damages and the remainder of her compensation due to an alleged breach of contract.</p><p>To seek closure for her grievances, according to Kelly’s statement, the model sent an invitation to Princess Diana in hopes of discussing their relationship with Dodi Fayed which went unanswered.</p><p>Prior to his engagements with Princess Diana and Kelly Fisher, Dodi Al Fayed was connected with an impressive list of iconic personalities.</p><p>According to the sources, the famed businessman associated with these names includes actresses Brooke Shields and Julia Roberts, fashion model Marie Helvin and actress Koo Stark.&nbsp;</p><p>Al Fayed further courted a string of renowned celebrities including Britt Ekland, <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a>, Daryl Hannah, and Joanne Whalley.</p><p>Additionally, he maintained connections with singer Tina Sinatra as well as TV personalities Tanya Brier and Susannah Constantine.
