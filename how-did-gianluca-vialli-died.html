Vialli was first told he had pancreatic cancer in 2017, and then again in 2021, not long after Italy won Euro 2020.</p><p style=color:#252525>In December, he quit his job with Italy, saying that he needed to get treatment for the disease.</p><p style=color:#252525>In the 1980s and 1990s, Vialli played for Cremonese, Sampdoria, and Juventus. In 1996, he joined Chelsea. After Ruud Gullit left the Blues in 1998, he took over as player-manager. That year, he led the club to victories in the League Cup, the Uefa Cup Winners‚Äô Cup, and the Uefa Super Cup.</p><p style=color:#252525>Vialli stopped playing at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season so he could focus on managing. The Italian led Chelsea to the FA Cup and Charity Shield titles in 2000 before being fired early in the 2000‚Äì01 season.</p><p style=color:#252525>Vialli played for Italy 59 times and scored 16 goals. He was most recently the head of delegation for the national team. The Azzurri helped Italy win Euro 2020 with their win over England at Wembley in July 2021.</p><p style=color:#252525>The Italian Football Federation said that all games this weekend that fall under its control will start with a minute of silence to remember Vialli. Vialli joined Chelsea in the summer of 1996, not long after he led Juventus to the Champions League title as captain.</p><p style=color:#252525>The club said he was a ‚ÄúChelsea legend‚Äù and that fans, players, and staff at Stamford Bridge loved him.</p><p style=color:#252525>In a statement, Chelsea‚Äôs chairman, Todd Boehly, and co-owner, Behdad Eghbali, said: ‚ÄúThis is a terrible day for the Chelsea Football Club.‚Äù At Stamford Bridge, Gianluca‚Äôs story will live on. ‚ÄúHis impact as a player, a coach, and, most importantly, as a person, will live on in the history of our club.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>You‚Äôll be missed by so many. A legend to us and to all of football.</p><p>Rest in peace, Gianluca Vialli. üíô <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mNJPDkCSYO</a></p><p>‚Äî Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 6, 2023</a></p><h2 id=ext-gen98 class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"><strong>What Is Pancreatic Cancer?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most dangerous kinds of cancer, and about 95% of people who get it die from it. Pancreatic cancer killed Joan Crawford, Patrick Swayze, and Luciano Pavarotti.</p><p style=color:#252525>It is the sixth most common type of cancer death in the UK. Each year, about 10,000 people in the UK and 55,000 people in the US are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</p><p style=color:#252525>It is caused when cells in the pancreas, a large gland in the digestive system, grow in a way that isn‚Äôt normal and can‚Äôt be stopped.</p><h2><strong>Who Has The Highest Risk?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>Ninety percent of cases involve people older than 55. People aged 75 and up account for roughly half of all new cases. One in ten cases can be explained by genes. Age, smoking, and other health problems, like diabetes, are also possible causes.</p><h2><strong>What Are The Treatment Options?</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>The only treatment that works is to take out the pancreas. People whose cancer has spread to other organs don‚Äôt get much help from this. In these situations, palliative care is recommended to help them feel less pain at the end of their lives.</p><p><strong>Read More</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Is John Travolta Straight Or Gay?
