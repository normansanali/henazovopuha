<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Why doesnt Ferb talk in Phineas and Ferb?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-characters=536 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Disney Channel’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Phineas and Ferb</a></strong> officially premiered in 2008 and concluded in 2015, after 129 episodes spanning four seasons. Created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff “Swampy” Marsh, the series follows Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. Every day, during Summer vacation, the boys embark on grand projects to invent some unrealistic and practically impossible devices, much to the dismay of their older sister Candace, who makes it her everyday duty to reveal the shenanigans to her and Phineas’ mother.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Ever since its debut, Phineas and Ferb has gained a cult following that mixes adults and children, especially as a lot of the humor targets older viewers, including its frequent pop-culture references. One of the many running gags in the musical-comedy animation is that Phineas’ stepbrother, Ferb, rarely ever talks. When he does, Ferb usually spurts some profound fact or chimes in at the very end of an episode for comedic effect.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>There are many elements of Phineas and Ferb that raised some questions: why Povenmire and Marsh chose a platypus as the family pet, whether or not Doofenshmirtz dated Phineas’ mother before she found Mr. Fletcher, and so on. However, one of the biggest head-scratchers revolved around Ferb Fletcher’s mute nature. Throughout the series, Ferb, portrayed by Thomas Sangster, has a minimal number of lines, and fans have always wondered about the significance behind it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/phineas-and-ferb-the-movie-candace-against-the-universe.jpg><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>Ferb has been described by Phineas as “a man of action,” and there never seemed to be a real urgency to make him talk. In the past, Ferb has been believed to be autistic or at the very least on the autism spectrum, and psychologists that study the theory have leaned towards that assumption being the case. Additionally, fans have believed that Jeff “Swampy” Marsh intended for the dynamic between Phineas and Ferb to pay homage to Wallace and Gromit, where the talkative inventor has a silent sidekick, as seen below in a Reddit thread discussing the topic..</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.reddit.com/r/phineasandferb/comments/7w21if/have_we_ever_found_out_from_the_writers_of_pandf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3</figure><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Ferb’s taciturnity has never been mentioned within the show, but there was a strong belief that the creators decided to make Ferb speak in a suave British accent late in development since they thought it would be funny if he broke out in that voice after not talking for an entire episode. Again, this is merely assumptions, as the source has not been cited in the theory. There are interviews with Marsh and Povenmire available to watch online, but they never explicitly explain the reasoning behind Ferb’s personality, presumably wishing to keep it open to interpretation.</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>In 2020, Marsh and Povenmire created the feature-length film Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe, the latest Phineas and Ferb adventure after the series concluded. Unfortunately, the future of the series remains unknown, but there are possibilities to expand the universe and keep the franchise alive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6ido6PBbrLEq5lmrJGhuG61zWanoaGemq60ecCnm2aelaevcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-youtube-channels-for-adults.html><span>←</span><span>The best YouTube channels for adults</span></a>
