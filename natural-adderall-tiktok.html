If you're trying to be the best at your job that you can possibly be, then that's going to require a tremendous amount of focus, commitment, and will.</p><p>Many find this last bit a challenge, and that could be why this "natural" Adderall supplement is trending on <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are tons of TikTokers who swear by L-Tyrosine, which they claim is like "natural Adderall."</h2><p>If you aren't familiar with Adderall, it's a prescription drug that requires close monitoring from a doctor and is generally prescribed to help treat <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">narcolepsy and ADHD</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The fact that there are so many people who take the substance with reckless abandon to do well on a test or to understand the various plot points of Tenet on their second watch doesn't change the fact that it's a lot like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crystal meth</a>, at least chemically speaking.</p><p>So how can folks get the same "Goku-level-focusing" of Adderall without all of the gnarly side effects of amphetamine abuse? Some think that going all natty could help with that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, TikTokers aren't really correct (shocker) in calling L-Tyrosine natural Adderall.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape</a>, L-Tyrosine isn't an amphetamine at all. It's actually a non-essential amino acid that one's body is able to create all on its own. It isn't extracted from any food or drink we consume. Tyrosine does, however, perform a very important function.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to Keri Gans, author of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Small Change Diet</a>, "Tyrosine may be found in all tissues of the human body and plays many roles, from producing enzymes and hormones to helping your nerve cells communicate through neurotransmitters."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what's the deal with calling Tyrosine "natural Adderall" if it doesn't bear a chemical resemblance to the drug?</h2><p>Well, consider for a second that your body isn't producing as much Tyrosine as it should. It seems that TikTok logic is assuming that taking this supplement will give your body a little Tyrosine "kick" that'll help your neurotransmitters fire on all cylinders.</p><p>As Jamie Alan, Ph.D., says, the amino acid is "a precursor — or starting material — for other molecules in your body" that can ultimately be converted into dopamine, which will infuse a rush of energy into a person's body.</p><p>So Tyrosine production affects neurotransmitters, whereas Adderall is a stimulant that has a direct effect on one's central nervous system.</p><p>If Tyrosine was really a "natural Adderall," theoretically it could help to treat narcolepsy and ADHD, which according to medical experts, it cannot.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Founder of Envision Wellness Erika Martinez says, "An ADHD brain is wired differently than a non-ADHD brain. To 'resolve' it would require re-wiring the brain which, to my knowledge, there's no pill for."</p><p>So no, Tyrosine cannot "cure" ADHD, that's because there is technically no "cure" for ADHD, according to Gail Satz, M.D.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Dr. Santosh Kesari, a neurologist at St. John's Health Center, says that L-Tyrosine is "not a medication" and added that he's extremely "wary of supplements" as "it's hard to know what you're getting."</p><p>Furthermore, Kesari stated that there aren't any definitive studies that show ingesting Tyrosine supplements functions the same way in one's body as when an individual produces it naturally.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>So is the "natural Adderall" on TikTok worth trying out? Only one thing is certain: It's worth doing your own research and talking to your doctor before adding any supplements like this to your regimen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo661wdGao2aZlJmys63LpWStoZupvKw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rachelle-wilkos-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rachelle Wilkos Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
