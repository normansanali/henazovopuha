One, it was super late. Like, a month late. And two, it has some really out-there lyrics. In the past, between Bible verses and religious imagery, Kanye made room for lyrics like old kickers “Couldn’t afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus,” from “All Falls Down,” and “Hurry up with my damn croissants” from “I Am a God.” The content in Jesus Is King is a little heavier, but food and <a href=#>obscure references</a> still stick out among his newer political statements. Here are a few of the lyrics that had us thinking, “I miss the old Kanye.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck26et662001u3h68fpoj83ef@published>“Selah”</h2><p>Everybody wanted Yandhi / Then Jesus Christ did the laundry</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26ewgtt00213h68u1nxsc1h@published data-word-count=52>Very Kanye West to call his fans out in a song. While it’s nowhere near the read Rihanna is going to give the Navy when her album finally comes out, Kanye acknowledges <a href=#>Yandhi’s</a> disappearance and makes it clear that Jesus threw that out with the bathwater. Kanye only makes <a href=#>gospel music</a> now.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ck26ez5y800283h68m1sqtxd7@published>“Closed on Sunday”</h2><p>Closed on Sunday / You my Chick-fil-A / You’re my number one / With the lemonade</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26ezlnv002f3h68jfmha4zv@published data-word-count=66>[*Genius lyrics annotation mode*] Chick-fil-A is an American fast-food establishment, famous for its Christian roots, polite employees, and being closed on Sunday as a testament to their faith. In 2017, they donated about $1.8 million to <a href=#>anti-LGBTQ organizations</a>. In this lyric, it seems Kanye is ordering a Classic Chicken Sandwich combo, substituting lemonade for the sweet tea. He does not specify which side order he’d like.</p><p>No more living for the culture, we nobody’s slave</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck26f8hc1002t3h68vlxai27p@published data-word-count=13>The irony of being anti-culture while actively creating culture.

Last year, Kanye actually <a href=#>tweeted</a> then <a href=#>walked back</a> this statement on TMZ, saying that he doesn’t think we need to abolish the 13th amendment to the Constitution (which, FYI, prohibits enslavement except as punishment for a crime). Instead, we should “amend” it.
