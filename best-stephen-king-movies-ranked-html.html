Sure, a lot of them are horror (certainly a lot of the worst are horror), but that’s largely because the boom period for King movies was the 1980s, when he was known solely as a horror writer. As his canvas (and reputation) has expanded over the years, his work has been turned into dramas, comedies, musicals, and even a Bollywood movie.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii91y000e3i5tkgniseb4@published data-word-count=111>Because of this dissonance, ranking King movies is particularly difficult: The Mangler and The Shawshank Redemption barely seem to exist on the same plane of dimensional existence, let alone on the same list of movies. Nonetheless, we gave it the old college try. (For the purposes of this list, we looked at theatrical releases only, which means the new straight-to-streaming prequel ﻿Pet Sematary: Bloodlines doesn’t qualify. And, we excluded Lawnmower Man, an “adaptation” so vastly different from the original that <a href=#>King sued</a> to get his name off it.) With one notable exception, you’ll find the adapted movies turned out much like King himself: They got more serious and substantial with age.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmjpgw001w3h6bxji4prks@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>46.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Maximum Overdrive" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Maximum Overdrive</a> (1986)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii91m000d3i5tfyx9nphe@published data-word-count=149>The one movie King ever directed, and … well, you know, Stephen King is a wonderful writer who should probably stick with writing. The movie’s tone is set in the opening scene, in which a man (played by King) tries to take money out of an ATM, and the ATM calls him an asshole. Apparently, a comet has passed by Earth and given mechanical objects sentience, and once they attack humanity, Emilio Estevez helps lead a human resistance. The movie isn’t even absurd enough to have fun with this lunatic premise, and King has zero skills as a director —&nbsp;visually, narratively, or in any other sense. King has called it the worst adaptation of any of his works, and we are not about to disagree. Though, <a href=#>according to King:</a> “I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and I really didn’t know what I was doing.”</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmke1r00363h6b47jwtlyr@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>45.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Mangler" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Mangler</a> (1995)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9i5000n3i5tyr13l3z2@published data-word-count=88>Of all the Stephen King adaptations, we must confess that this one has our favorite title. Boy, though, is this thing ridiculous. What, exactly, is “the Mangler,” you ask? Well, the Mangler is a demonically possessed … laundry press! This setup leads to hilarious scenes of an angry laundry press pressing up and down, like a hungry, hungry hippo. Eventually the Mangler develops legs and starts chasing people. It’s all terrible, but, you never know, it might be your thing. Maybe you’re into laundry-press cosplay.

Its premise: Overnight workers at an abandoned-then-reopened textile mill keep dying, and no one can figure out why. Wanna guess why? We don’t want to give it away. All right, they’re being killed by … a giant bat! Because bats hunt at night, you see. (In the short story, it’s a giant rat. Bats are much more cinematic.) This movie looks like it was made for about $35, but it does feature a truly insane closing credits song.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmntbx00363h6bzxdi4ino@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>43.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Riding the Bullet" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Riding the Bullet</a> (2004)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii96h000h3i5txwn9db7y@published data-word-count=104>What was a thin, simple premise in King’s novella — widely considered the world’s first e-book, by the way, in 2000 — is extended to little effect in this drama about a man who tries to kill himself, then hitchhikes across the country to visit his dying mother. Director Mick Garris is an old King hired hand — he directed several of King’s straight-to-TV movies, including The Stand and the version of The Shining that had Steven Weber, of all people, in the Jack Nicholson role — and he tries to make this into something much more portentous and profound than it really is.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmoeqz004g3h6b92x53b3e@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>42.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Sleepwalkers href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Sleepwalkers</a> (1992)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9ar000i3i5tsli037nc@published data-word-count=145>It’s Mick Garris again (this was actually his first collaboration with King), hacking away at another King movie, this time with an original script from King. What are “Sleepwalkers,” you ask? According to the <a href=#>Stephen King Wiki,</a> they’re “an ancient and forgotten nomadic race of vampiric shape-shifting werecats.” In the movie, they’re an incestuous mother and son who need to feed on virgin blood, and … well, you can probably guess where it goes from there. Amusingly, the Sleepwalkers cannot survive contact with simple house cats, which leads to all sorts of ridiculous scenes of our bad guy screaming in horror at the sight of Garfield. This movie is probably most famous for being terrible, but secondarily for having all sorts of horror-movie cameos, from King himself to Tobe Hooper to John Landis to Ron Perlman to Mark Hamill to Clive Barker to Joe Dante.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmoula005q3h6bp07ildqg@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>41.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Silver Bullet" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Silver Bullet</a> (1985)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9bh000j3i5tayhx4zz1@published data-word-count=32>Considered faintly ridiculous when it came out, Silver Bullet looks even worse now; the special effects and creature makeup are bad even for a horror movie from 1985.

Jackson in a King movie crashes and burns in a dumb cautionary tale about … well, about how cell phones are going to kill us all by sending a signal that turns us into murderous monsters. King wrote the book early enough (2006) in the age of portable technology that it seems helplessly dated by 2016. Our smartphones have come up with far more creative ways to kill us today.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmpqc8008a3h6bf21rbsp7@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>39.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Dolan’s Cadillac" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Dolan’s Cadillac</a> (2009)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5siia8l00103i5tv0yo1cfr@published data-word-count=111>This is not a documentary about a fancy American car belonging to the Knicks owner, though you have to admit it wouldn’t be that surprising to see that show up at MSG some summer afternoon. Instead, this is a slight, limp crime thriller starring Christian Slater and Wes Bentley — years before each faded star would make a comeback — based off an old King short story that even he had probably forgotten. The movie tries to be a grindhouse schlockfest, but can barely work up the energy. This got a brief theatrical release before zipping straight to video, and has only ever been brought up again in lists like this.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cl39489to005e3f6q3gtagjlm@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>38.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Firestarter href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Firestarter</a> (2022)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cl3947qbt00433f6qd732wuo3@published data-word-count=128>The original Firestarter — which is better than this, if only because of its insane cast — was supposed to be directed by John Carpenter. Carpenter does the music for this remake, and the music is without question the best part: Its synth-heavy creepiness promises an ‘80s horror vibe that, unfortunately, the movie never really delivers. Zac Efron plays the father of a little girl who can set things on fire with her mind, and the casting is more convincing as a career move than as the right choice for the movie: Efron is just too callow to be persuasive. The movie is mostly dull, and by the time it goes full burn-it-all-down at the ending, you’ll have lost track what this was supposed to be about anyway.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmq642009k3h6b7jaol1rb@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>37.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Cat’s Eye" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Cat’s Eye</a> (1985)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9gs000m3i5to85031ug@published data-word-count=110>This was made back when horror anthologies were all the rage, and King was at the center of them. The gimmick here: There’s one cat that connects all three stories, two based off Night Shift stories and one written for the film by King. The biggest star at the time was Drew Barrymore, fresh off not just E.T. but Firestarter. But the best performance in the best vignette comes from James Woods, as a man who is so desperate to quit smoking he will try anything. The movie feels pretty dashed off, and it’s more reminiscent of The Twilight Zone’s whimsy than it is scary. But there is a cat.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmqnmo00au3h6bxcn24id4@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>36.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Needful Things" href=#>Needful Things</a> (1993)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9il000o3i5tj7blglrg@published data-word-count=84>You wouldn’t think a moral fable about a possibly demonic shop owner (played by Max von Sydow!) wreaking havoc on a sleepy small town, pursued by heroic sheriff Ed Harris, could possibly be bad — but, alas, it is. With a better director than Fraser Clarke “Son of Charlton” Heston, Von Sydow’s whimsical evil would have had menace and wit, but this plodding film has neither. How do you make Harris and Amanda Plummer boring? It’s really hard! Needful Things somehow finds a way.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmr39j00c43h6b1zqspqtm@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>35.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Creepshow 2" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Creepshow 2</a> (1987)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9v1000t3i5te8uvk0mv@published data-word-count=94>The sequel doesn’t feature George Romero behind the camera (though he did write the screenplay), but it’s still based on King stories — albeit lesser-known, less-fun ones than the original. None of these are as scary or as inventive as in the first film, though “The Raft” — in which horny teenagers get devoured by a creature from the deep lake in which they’re swimming — makes us squeamish still today. This one did poorly enough that it would be 20 years until they made another one, and neither Romero nor King were involved.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clfsn3730001m3b6u9nbh7lmu@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>34.</p></span>Mr. Harrigan’s Phone (2022)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfsn3bzq002y3b6umwxuruk0@published data-word-count=133>A classic high-concept King premise: A teenager named Craig (Jaeden Martell, a little older and a little less interesting than he was in the It movies) develops a friendship with an elderly man (Donald Sutherland, forever casually menacing) and, when the man dies, places a phone he’d bought for him in the man’s casket. Because he misses talking to the man, he calls the phone when he has problems with a local bully, and, wouldn’t you know it … the bully is found dead the next day. Then the phone starts texting Craig back. What could have been a true old-school King creeper ends up a bit of a soggy coming-of-age story: The movie never really recovers when Sutherland leaves. Also: Don’t give old people social media; their lives have been hard enough.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmrkz600de3h6bvcpkpx5v@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>33.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Night Flier " href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Night Flier</a> (1997)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju4btbse00na3g65g21bfll7@published data-word-count=103>One thing King hasn’t written a lot about is journalism and media (at least, not until Twitter and the Donald Trump administration). He does try his hand at it with this adaptation of a short story about a schlock TV journalist (the late Miguel Ferrer) trying to track down a vampire. Ferrer’s actually pretty great in this — he’s a perfect seedy journalist — but the movie isn’t smart or sharp enough to do much with him. King has said that Ferrer’s character is the same “Richard Dees” who pops up as a shady journalist in The Dead Zone, for what that’s worth.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtms5jg00fx3h6bf2u3qawi@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>32.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Firestarter href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Firestarter</a> (1984)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9r1000p3i5tull1wip0@published data-word-count=135>Drew Barrymore had her first post-E.T. starring role as a little girl who can set things on fire with her mind. Barrymore is able to make a mean-little-girl face with the best of them, even if the movie’s a little too dark and scary for an 8-year-old (much like Barrymore’s life at the time, actually). It’s not great; King himself said it was one of the worst movies based on one of his books. Fun trivia: Firestarter was originally supposed to be directed by John Carpenter, but the studio rejected him because The Thing had flopped. This movie would have been a lot better if it had been directed by John Carpenter. By the way: This was the only time George C. Scott, Art Carney, Martin Sheen, and Heather Locklear would share a screen together.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmsjnf00h73h6bf6xizdcp@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>31.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Dreamcatcher href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Dreamcatcher</a> (2003)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9r3000q3i5t74iarr58@published data-word-count=95>Otherwise known as “the movie where Lawrence Kasdan went off the rails,” Dreamcatcher had everything going for it, from Kasdan to a William Goldman/Kasdan script to Morgan Freeman and Thomas Jane and Timothy Olyphant. But the film is a total mess, start to finish: a mishmash of It and some military-thriller, monster-movie clichés culminating in a junky special-effects ending that barely makes sense. It is bizarre that people this smart and this talented made such a misfire. For what it’s worth, after this movie, there weren’t any big-budget studio King adaptations until The Dark Tower.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmsxuz00ih3h6bnyeqv01y@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>30.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Dark Tower " href=#>The Dark Tower </a>(2017)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5whtgz500003k5t8ed52u18@published data-word-count=188>After years of false starts and, more recently, months of bad buzz, the long-anticipated adaptation of King’s beloved Dark Tower series proves to be kinda dull, in the most inoffensive way imaginable. Actually, that’s what’s most disappointing about the finished film: At least if it had been outright terrible, it might have been more memorable. We have no complaint with Idris Elba as the badass, square-jawed Gunslinger, who takes awkward teen Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor) under his wing, quickly realizing he has the power to destroy the Dark Tower and, consequently, the universe. But we have plenty of complaints with Matthew McConaughey, who plays the Man in Black as if he’s still doing his goddamn suave-mumbling-mystic routine from his terrible Lincoln ads. The Dark Tower has <a href=#>gotten the stamp of approval from King</a>, and the movie has cheeky blink-and-you’ll-miss-‘em references to other King works like The Shining, 1408, and The Shawshank Redemption. But the film never really gets out of the blocks — it comes across as merely the vague notion of what an epic spectacle should look like, but without the audacity, vision, or soul of one.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmtm4n00jr3h6bwaoh0syx@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>29.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="Pet Sematary" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Pet Sematary</a> (1989)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5sii9tz000s3i5tvw3tiphl@published data-word-count=125>Considered by some to be King’s scariest book, Pet Sematary becomes less of a queasy moral fable and more of a traditional horror, jump-scare picture in the hands of director Mary Lambert. King has never had much of an issue about putting kids in peril in his books — It is basically entirely about that — but it’s still a bit much to see a toddler being hit by a truck turn into such a pivotal plot point. Interestingly: This is, as far as we can tell, the only movie on this entire list to be directed by a woman, other than the remake of Carrie. (Coincidentally, Lambert was friends with the Ramones and got them to write the titular song for the closing credits.)</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtmtzbc00l13h6bkkzg2dwz@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>28.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Dark Half " href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Dark Half</a> (1993)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5siia9s00113i5tx6c556k1@published data-word-count=117>Directed by George Romero during that brief period in the ‘80s when he wasn’t making zombie movies, this is one of King’s “nothing in the world is scarier than life as a writer” movies.

It’s a ridiculous premise that’s played weirdly straight, but it does feature a loopy, fun performance from Hutton, against type.

Taking liberties with the source material, directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer have crafted a superior Pet Sematary to the 1989 version, for several reasons. The first is that this remake manages to be more consistently unnerving and mournful, really sinking its teeth into a dark fundamental truth: Even the most levelheaded of people simply cannot let go of the past or the loved ones they lose along the way. In addition, this Pet Sematary has a much better cast, led by Jason Clarke as a rock-steady patriarch who doesn’t believe in an afterlife until he discovers that his backyard is home to a cemetery that can resurrect the dead — sort of. And finally, it’s those twists on King’s book, which we won’t reveal, that allow the film to find its own creepy, despairing tone. Like too much modern horror, the remake indulges in lame jump scares and questionable plotting.

To be sure, there is too much stuffed into The Green Mile — woozy ideas about redemption, an affected sense of awe — and as touching as Duncan’s portrayal of Coffey is, Darabont treats the character like a simplistic, irritatingly naïve beacon of goodness.

But the Warner Bros. film sticks to the characters as outcast teens, whereas the planned sequel will flash-forward to when they’re adults once again confronting this spooky specter. Remarkably, though, director Andy Muschietti’s thriller doesn’t feel incomplete without the second segment, more than capably delivering enough scares and emotional resonance — not to mention an ending that leaves the door open for the next installment but closes this chapter with real power.

Terror doesn’t await them — unless you count universal anxieties, such as puberty — and while the film is undeniably nostalgic for the unhurried drift of youth, it’s pretty smart about how seemingly minor adventures become, in hindsight, defining moments in a life.

One of these is dopey (“Father’s Day”); one of these is terrible but features an incredibly strange and oddly entertaining performance from King himself (“The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill”); one is good old monster-movie scary (“The Crate”); one is a true ‘80s relic (“Something to Tide You Over,” which features the amazing spectacle of Leslie Nielsen trying to kill Ted Danson); and one is still fantastic and skin-crawling today (“They’re Creeping Up on You,” with E. G. Marshall as a rich germaphobe who will remind you quite a bit of our current president). It’s inconsistent, but still a load of fun.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtn3gdb01kl3h6bfa4lr39t@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>5.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Misery href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Misery</a> (1990)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju4bzcd700zx3g65lq4mclyt@published data-word-count=234>Nearly 30 years after Kathy Bates won the Oscar for her performance in Misery, it remains as surprising an occurrence as it did when the respected stage actress took to the podium to accept her prize, <a href=#>declaring</a>, “I’d like to thank the Academy — I’ve been waiting a long time to say that.” That’s no knock on her remarkable portrayal — a perfect blend of menace and dark humor — but rather an acknowledgment that this isn’t the kind of role that usually gets accolades. Misery, a horror movie with a satiric streak, launched Bates’s film stardom. She’s fantastic as Annie Wilkes, the obsessive fan of Paul Sheldon (James Caan), a popular romance author who she holds prisoner in her home until he agrees to abandon his new manuscript — which she hates — and write something more to her liking. Annie could have been an easy, misogynistic monster, but in Bates’s hands, the character is turned into a complicated portrait of obsession, revealing the dangers of losing oneself in the work of others. Bates is frightening in her stillness, which makes Annie’s sudden bursts of violence all the more horrifying. But sneaky dark humor comes from the actress’s malicious glee at landing such a rich role. Annie may be a lunatic, but she’s Paul’s comeuppance — a clever reminder that vain artists can be held captive by their need for stardom, sometimes literally.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtn3zjh01n43h6bvg5wjw41@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>4.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Shawshank Redemption" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Shawshank Redemption</a> (1994)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5siiatt002q3i5tzemq1fnl@published data-word-count=225>King has such a low opinion of so many of the bad movies made from his work, one assumes he’d be fond of Frank Darabont’s Best Picture–nominated version of the early-1980s novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. But King had his concerns about Darabont’s screenplay: “Oh, man, no chance they’re going to make a movie out of this puppy,” the author told the Huffington Post he <a href=#>remembered thinking</a>. “It’s too talky. It’s great, but it’s too much talking.” King wasn’t wrong: The film is too talky. But guided by its deeply likable leads, The Shawshank Redemption warmly and (relatively) understatedly walks us through its Big Themes: friendship, empathy, and that moment when a man decides whether to get busy living or get busy dying. Darabont’s thoughtful character study sees incarceration as a metaphorical purgatory in which people find their true selves — a notion that has helped make The Shawshank Redemption <a href=#>a now-permanent fixture at the top</a> of IMDb’s user-voted best films of all time. Not surprisingly, the movie’s rhapsodic online devotion has provoked an equally passionate backlash. Neither reaction does justice to this modest tearjerker, which, ironically, works best when it’s muted and contemplative. Hardly a masterpiece and certainly not a sappy, populist embarrassment, The Shawshank Redemption is simply a solid, good movie — an assessment that will probably annoy people in both camps.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtn4d3k01oe3h6bismo9d3e@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>3.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Dead Zone" href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>The Dead Zone</a> (1983)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju4c0znq018l3g65o8winime@published data-word-count=172>Perhaps the most underrated Stephen King movie and the most underrated David Cronenberg movie, this haunted thriller is basically the “would you go back in time to kill Hitler if you could?” premise, put on film. Christopher Walken is the doomed Johnny Smith, a schoolteacher who gains the ability to touch someone and see their future after a car-accident-induced coma. This uncanny ability leads him to a senatorial candidate (Martin Sheen — inspired casting), who Johnny learns will someday become president and blow up the world. Cronenberg gives the whole movie a funereal pall: a sense that sad things are going to happen to good people, but there’ll be a sad honor to it all. Real-world parallels between Sheen’s Greg Stillson (who hires goons and thugs to push an authoritarian regime) and current presidents aside, the movie holds up splendidly today, not least of all thanks to Walken, who is as likable and leading-man-handsome as he would ever be. It’s one of his best performances. Seek it out — it’s still great.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtn4v5901qx3h6b8teg9mnz@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>2.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text=Carrie href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow data-track-type=product-link>Carrie</a> (1976)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5siiav2002s3i5t2lt7ykil@published data-word-count=260>King’s breakthrough as an author famously <a href=#>almost didn’t happen</a>. While working on Carrie, the struggling writer tossed his initial few pages into the trash, ready to abandon the idea of a telekinetic teen, until his wife pulled them out of the garbage and insisted he keep going. Director Brian De Palma turned that book into one of the singular teen dramas — which just so happens to be one of the great horror films. Sissy Spacek is superb as Carrie, a small-town gal as terrified about her budding womanhood as she is of her shaming, religious-zealot mother (Piper Laurie, practically demonic). People think of Carrie as being frightening but, until its murderous finale at the high-school dance, the movie’s dread has little to do with gore or body count. Rather, De Palma puts us into the paranoid mind of a young person, showing how her daily life is a waking nightmare that a lot of high-schoolers can recognize as their own: the pain of first love, the awkwardness of feeling like a weirdo, the strange changes in your body, the anxiety of figuring out popularity. Above all, Carrie is a beautifully calibrated, slowly escalating symphony of tension. By the time prom comes and Carrie sets her classmates aflame, it’s both a relief and a shock. In the wake of Columbine, films such as Elephant and We Need to Talk About Kevin wrestled with the reasons why kids take up arms to express their misery. But Carrie remains the most disturbing and sympathetic film about the hell inside so many teens.</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckbtn5am201s73h6b7sufoadl@published><span class=ordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>1.</p></span><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Shining" href=#>The Shining</a> (1980)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju4c06l4012g3g65xz3tudoc@published data-word-count=293>Perversely, one of the reasons that The Shining is such a beloved horror film is that Stephen King hates it so. “I don’t get it,” he <a href=#>said in 2014</a> about the movie’s passionate fans. “But there are a lot of things that I don’t get. But obviously people absolutely love it, and they don’t understand why I don’t. The book is hot, and the movie is cold; the book ends in fire, and the movie in ice.” This is a large chunk of the movie’s appeal: Director Stanley Kubrick took the basic idea of King’s acclaimed novel and distorted it. Instead of a tragedy about a decent, flawed man who goes insane, we get Jack Nicholson’s pathetic Jack Torrance, a grandiose, pompous ass who dreams of literary glory, dragging his unhappy family to a remote ski lodge, resulting in bloodshed and agony. Kubrick’s film is a hell of a black comedy that satirizes the mediocrity of middle-class life: In the director’s world, fathers are pitiful providers, mothers are blandly cheerful (while quietly suffering enormously), and the kids see far more than their parents do. But by stripping the story down to its core elements — supernatural powers, madness, claustrophobia — Kubrick opened viewers’ minds to a treasure trove of possible interpretations, many of which were compiled in the wonderfully labyrinthine documentary <a href=#>Room 237.</a> (Not surprisingly, King hates that movie, too.) But if Kubrick’s Shining is so cold, why, then, do we keep revisiting it and devouring its details, enraptured over and over again by its meticulous construction and elegant horror? Is it, just maybe, that it’s the only King adaptation that actually improves on the source material — giving us not just one way to look at the author’s masterful work, but two?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj5siibi9002w3i5tkfuu6x11@published data-word-count=22>Grierson & Leitch write regularly about the movies and host a <a href=#>podcast on film</a>.
